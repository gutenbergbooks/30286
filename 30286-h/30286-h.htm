<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>Somewhere out in the night a woman was crying,
crying desolately. The sad, rather monotonous
sound broke the silence of the street and floated
through the open window of a room where Micky Mellowes
was wondering how the deuce he should get
through the long evening lying before him.</p>
<p>Micky was in a bad temper. It was not often that he
was in a bad temper, but he had begun the day by waking
with a headache, which was still with him, and which
accounted for the wide open window and the breath of
icy air which was filling the room and fluttering the
curtains; and half an hour ago some people with whom
he had been going to dine had rung up and told him that
the party was off owing to the sudden death of a relative,
thereby leaving the evening long and empty on his
hands.</p>
<p>It was New Year&rsquo;s Eve, too, which made matters a
thundering sight worse.</p>
<p>He wondered if Marie Deland was feeling as sick
about it as he was. Micky was in the middle of an interesting
flirtation with Marie, which bade fair to develop
into something deeper with careful engineering on
the part of her family, for Micky was a catch, and
though so far he had proved himself singularly adroit
in avoiding mothers with marriageable daughters, the
Delands were beginning to pat each other on the back
and to look pleased.</p>
<p>When the sound of crying reached him he had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
feeling so thoroughly fed-up with life that it had seemed
impossible for anything ever to interest him again; but
now he climbed out of his chair with a faint show of
energy and strolled over to the window.</p>
<p>It was a cold, clear night, with myriads of stars in
the dark sky that seemed to shed a faintly luminous
light to earth, bright enough at all events for Micky
to distinguish the figure of a girl walking slowly along
the pathway below.</p>
<p>She was walking so slowly and dispiritedly that a sort
of vague curiosity stirred in Micky&rsquo;s heart; here, at least,
was some one even more fed-up with life than he himself,
and with a sudden impulse he turned from the window,
and, snatching up a hat and coat which he had
thrown down when he came in an hour earlier, made
for the stairs.</p>
<p>He was half-way down when an apologetic cough at
his elbow arrested him; he stopped and turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir, Mr. Ashton has just sent round
to ask if you could make it convenient to be in at ten
o&rsquo;clock this evening, as he wants to see you particularly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky looked surprised; Ashton had been very particularly
engaged for that evening, he knew. Evidently
something had happened to upset his plans as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten o&rsquo;clock? All right; I dare say I shall be in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on down the stairs.</p>
<p>Out on the path he paused and looked up and down
the street.</p>
<p>The impulse that had sent him out had died away;
it was beastly cold, and much more comfortable by the
fire. He hesitated, and in that moment he saw the figure
of the girl again.</p>
<p>She had stopped now in the light of a street lamp,
and seemed to be looking at something she carried in
her arms&ndash;&ndash;a child! Surely not a child!</p>
<p>Micky&rsquo;s curiosity was aroused. He buttoned the collar
of his coat more closely round his chin and went on.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></div>
<p>The girl had moved too, almost as if she felt instinctively
that she was being followed, and as Micky drew
abreast with her she shrank a little to one side as if
afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Micky bluntly.</p>
<p>They were some few yards from the lamp now. But,
as she turned to look up at him with startled eyes, its
yellow light fell on her face; and Micky saw with amazement
that she was quite young and exceedingly pretty,
in spite of the distress in her eyes, and the tears that
were still wet on her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked again, more gently, and
waited for the pathetically shaken denial which he felt
sure would come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&ndash;&ndash;nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; There was a note of exasperation in his
voice. &ldquo;You were crying&ndash;&ndash;I heard you, and people don&rsquo;t
walk about the streets at this time of night and cry if
there&rsquo;s nothing the matter. If that&rsquo;s a baby you&rsquo;ve got
with you, you ought to know better than to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He
broke off. She was laughing, a weak, uncertain little
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A baby!&rdquo; she said tremulously. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a baby; it&rsquo;s
a cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cat!&rdquo; Micky&rsquo;s voice was full of disgust. He looked
down at her from his superior height with sudden suspicion.
If this was just a hoax?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter anyway?&rdquo; he asked again.</p>
<p>She looked away from him without answering.</p>
<p>Micky began to feel a bit of a fool; he wished he had
not yielded to the impulse to follow her. After all, it
was no business of his if a stranger chose to walk about
his road and weep; he looked at her impatiently.</p>
<p>Her hair beneath its not very smart hat shone golden
in the lamplight, and the little oval of cheek and rounded
chin which was all he could see of her averted face
somehow touched a forgotten chord in his heart and
made him think of his boyhood and the girl-mother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
who had not lived long enough to be more than a memory....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m interfering or trying to annoy you,&rdquo;
he said again. &ldquo;But if there is anything I can do to
help you....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anything.... I ought to have
known better than to let you hear that I was crying
... there&rsquo;s nothing the matter, I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Then quite
suddenly she broke down again into bitter sobbing. &ldquo;Oh,
I&rsquo;m so miserable&ndash;&ndash;so utterly miserable&ndash;&ndash;I wish I were
dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky was appalled; he had heard women say that
sort of thing before, and had said it himself scores of
times, but never with that note of tragedy which he heard
in this girl&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Ten minutes ago he had considered himself the most
miserable of mortals because he had been let down over
a dinner; he was ashamed of his temper now as he stood
there in the starlight and listened to this girl&rsquo;s sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said after a moment, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll never feel
any better if you stay out here in the cold. I don&rsquo;t
suppose you&rsquo;ve had a respectable meal for hours either&ndash;&ndash;I
know what women are. Where do you live? You&rsquo;ll
soon feel better when you get beside a fire and have
something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going home any more,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She spoke quite quietly, but with a sort of despair
which there was no mistaking.</p>
<p>Micky was a rapid thinker. He had clean forgotten
his headache. This was adventure with a capital letter.
There was still something of romance in the world which
his jaded palate had not yet tasted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re tired,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;and probably
fed-up. So am I. I was just wondering what in the
world to do with myself when I heard you crying. It
made me feel a sort of kinship with you&ndash;&ndash;it did, upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
my word. If I&rsquo;d been a woman I dare say I should have
been howling like anything. Will you come along with
me and let me give you some supper? I&rsquo;m hungry
too....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrank back from him with a little gesture of
fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no&ndash;&ndash;please let me go!...&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to pass him, but Micky barred the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t walk about the streets all night,&rdquo; he said
determinedly. &ldquo;The cat will hate it anyway, even if you
don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo; There was a hint of laughter in his voice,
though he had never felt more serious in all his life.
&ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t want me to take pity on you, you
might at least take pity on me ... please don&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;m a bounder trying to annoy you or anything like that
... perhaps I want a friend just as badly as you
do....&rdquo; He stopped, aghast at his own temerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do,&rdquo; she said tremulously, &ldquo;I am more sorry
for you than I can say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you said that,&rdquo; Micky answered, &ldquo;because
now you&rsquo;ll come along and have that supper with me.
There&rsquo;s a little caf&eacute; quite near here that I know. If we
are both miserable, we can at least be miserable together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something told him that this girl was at the end of her
tether; that she was desperate, and his first casual curiosity
concerning her deepened in the most surprising
fashion.</p>
<p>He felt in some inexplicable way that a curtain had
been lifted from a phase of life hitherto hidden from
him; as if he were standing on the threshold of a new
world, where women only weep for something real and
tragic, not just butterfly tears of petulance like the women
of his own class.</p>
<p>The girl was silent for a moment; then suddenly she
laughed, a hard little laugh of recklessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I suppose I may as well.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></div>
<p>Micky was infinitely relieved; somehow he had not
really thought that she would allow him to accompany
her.</p>
<p>They walked along for a few steps in silence. Once
or twice the cat, tucked under the girl&rsquo;s arm, gave a faint
mieow of protest, and Micky smiled to himself in the
darkness.</p>
<p>It was the cat that seemed to give such a real touch
of pathos to the whole adventure, he thought, and wondered
why. He looked down at her deprecatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me carry it,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carry it?&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;What do you mean?&ndash;&ndash;Oh,
the cat; no, thank you. He wouldn&rsquo;t like it: he hates
strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Micky. He felt chagrined. &ldquo;Is it a great
pet?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She hunched her queer burden more closely
under her arm. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t really mine,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;But they were so unkind to it in the house that I had
to bring it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky was dying to ask questions, but somehow it
hardly seemed a propitious moment. He did not speak
again till they reached the little caf&eacute;.</p>
<p>It was a quiet little downstairs place, and just now was
almost deserted.</p>
<p>Micky chose a corner table which was partially
screened from the rest of the room. As he stood up to
take off his coat he looked at the girl interestedly.</p>
<p>She was better than pretty, he decided with a little
pleasurable thrill; he could not remember when he had
seen a face that appealed to him so strongly in spite of
its pathos and the tear stains round her eyes.</p>
<p>And such sweet eyes they were!&ndash;&ndash;really grey with dark
lashes and daintily pencilled brows. She looked up suddenly,
meeting his earnest regard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said. There was a touch of defiance in
her voice; the colour had risen in her white cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Micky with a friendly smile.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>He sat down opposite to her; he was thanking his lucky
stars that the Delands&rsquo; message had reached him before
he changed into evening clothes; somehow as he looked at
this girl he felt slightly ashamed of his own lazy, luxurious
life and the banking account which, like the cruse of
oil, never failed. That this girl had no surplus of this
world&rsquo;s goods he was certain, though she was neatly
dressed and was unmistakably a lady. Her gloves were
worn and had been carefully mended, and her coat looked
far too thin for such a cold night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are we going to have?&rdquo; he asked. It was
surprising how cheerful he felt. &ldquo;And what about that
wonderful cat of yours? By the way, hasn&rsquo;t it got a
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call him Charlie,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie!&rdquo; Micky&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s original,
anyway,&rdquo; he said with a chuckle. &ldquo;And Charlie must
have some milk, I suppose. I say, he&rsquo;s a bit thin, isn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; he asked dubiously.</p>
<p>She had taken off the shawl which had been wrapped
about it, and the poor animal sat on her lap blinking in
the light, a forlorn enough specimen, with a long tail and
fierce eyes.</p>
<p>The girl stroked its head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been half starved,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be thin if
you hadn&rsquo;t had any more to eat than he&rsquo;s had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I should,&rdquo; said Micky humbly. He thought
guiltily of the waste which he knew went on in his own
establishment; it was odd that it had never struck him
before that there must be many people in the world, not
to mention cats, who would be glad enough of the waste
from his table.</p>
<p>He picked up the menu to hide his discomfort. When
the waiter came he ordered the best dinner the restaurant
served. He was conscious that the girl was watching
him anxiously. When the waiter had gone, she said, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t afford to have a dinner like that.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></div>
<p>Micky flushed crimson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were dining with me,&rdquo; he stammered.
&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I hope you will&ndash;&ndash;I shall be only too honoured....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her grey eyes met his anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never done a thing like this before,&rdquo; she said in
distress. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are thinking of me
... but ... well, I suppose I was just desperate....&rdquo;
She broke off biting her lip, then she
rushed on again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;ll ever see me
any more, so it doesn&rsquo;t really matter much, but....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to see you again, many times,&rdquo; said Micky,
with an earnestness that surprised himself.</p>
<p>She looked away, and her face hardened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose men are all the same,&rdquo; she said, after a
moment. &ldquo;However....&rdquo; she shrugged her shoulders
with a sort of recklessness that made Micky frown. She
leaned back in her chair with sudden weariness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
very kind of you,&rdquo; she said disinterestedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not kind at all,&rdquo; he hastened to assure her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
much more pleased to be with you than you are to be with
me. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you I should have spent this
evening alone&ndash;&ndash;New Year&rsquo;s Eve, too,&rdquo; he added, with a
sort of chagrin and a sudden memory of Marie Deland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New Year&rsquo;s Eve!&rdquo; she echoed. She closed her eyes
for a moment, and Micky had an uncomfortable sort of
feeling that she was looking back on the year that was
dying and could see nothing pleasant in the whole of the
twelve months. Presently she opened them again with a
little sigh. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want another year like the
last one,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have,&rdquo; he told her promptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a
sort of feeling that there are lots of good things coming
along for you. The luck has to change some time or
other, and if you&rsquo;ve had a rotten time in the past you
won&rsquo;t have it in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in luck,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you? I do,&rdquo; Micky declared. He hated the
despondency in her face; he felt a strong desire to see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
her smiling and happy. He rattled on, talking any nonsense
that came into his head.</p>
<p>The waiter came down the room and set the dishes
on the table. He gave a sort of supercilious sniff when
Micky asked for a saucer of milk for the cat. He looked
at Charlie with scorn&ndash;&ndash;Charlie, curled up on the girl&rsquo;s
lap now and purring lustily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you know, we really ought to have a bottle
of wine,&rdquo; Micky said dubiously. &ldquo;Just something cheap,
as it&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Eve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would like to have given her champagne, but dared
not suggest it. He was quite sure that if she knew he
was a rich man she would fly off at a tangent. He ordered
an inexpensive bottle of red wine and filled her
glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s luck to the New Year,&rdquo; he said sententiously.
&ldquo;And to our delightfully unexpected meeting,&rdquo;
he added.</p>
<p>She flushed up to her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you always as kind to people as you have been to
me?&rdquo; she asked tensely.</p>
<p>Micky blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t call this being
kind, do you? I assure you it&rsquo;s just pure selfishness. I
should have spent my evening alone if we hadn&rsquo;t met&ndash;&ndash;and
I hate being alone; I bore myself stiff in five minutes.
I&rsquo;m just&ndash;&ndash;honoured that you should have allowed
me to eat my supper with you. If you knew how beastly
fed-up I was feeling ... the world seemed a positively
loathsome place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed; she leaned her elbows on the table and
her chin in her hands, looking at him with thoughtful
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you poor?&rdquo; she asked with disarming frankness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor as a church mouse,&rdquo; said Micky promptly. &ldquo;At
least&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he hastened to amend his words&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m one of
those unfortunate beggars who spend money as fast as
they get it. I&rsquo;ve never saved a halfpenny in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>This at least was the truth.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither have I&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve never had one to save....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The despondency was back again in her voice; Micky
broke in hastily&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we go any further I think we ought to know
one another&rsquo;s names.&rdquo; He fumbled in a pocket for a
card, but changed his mind quickly, remembering that
his cards bore the address of the expensive flat which he
honoured with his presence. &ldquo;My name is Mellowes,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got several Christian names as well, but people
call me Micky....&rdquo; He waited, looking at her
expectantly. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me yours?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She was staring down at her plate. He could see the
dark fringe of lashes against her cheeks. Suddenly she
looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to know my name? We shall
never meet again, I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky leaned a little forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;it will be the greatest
disappointment I have ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him with a sort of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; she said, with a catch in her
voice. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really mean that ... you&rsquo;re just
one of those men who say things like that to every woman
you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She broke off, struck by the chagrin in Micky&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;I oughtn&rsquo;t to have said that,&rdquo; she went on
hurriedly. &ldquo;I beg your pardon ... I ought not to
have said it, and I will tell you my name if you really
want to know. My name is Esther&ndash;&ndash;Esther Shepstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; said Micky. &ldquo;And now we&rsquo;re going to
drink to good resolutions for the New Year ...
have you made one yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use? Besides ... I don&rsquo;t want to
make any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, I&rsquo;ll make one for you.&rdquo; He refilled
her glass and handed it to her. &ldquo;Now say after me: &lsquo;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
resolve that during the coming year I will be good friends
with Micky Mellowes&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo; Oh, I say, don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;please
don&rsquo;t....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had dropped her face in her hands again, and
Micky had a miserable conviction that she was crying.</p>
<p>But he was wrong, for presently she looked up again,
and her eyes were dry, though a little hard and bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in a man&rsquo;s friendship for a woman,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll say it, if you like,&rdquo; and she took the
glass from his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to-morrow,&rdquo; said Micky presently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
take you out to tea or something&ndash;&ndash;if I may,&rdquo; he added
hurriedly.</p>
<p>He waited, but she did not speak. &ldquo;May I?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She was twisting the stem of her wineglass nervously;
after a moment she began to speak jerkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I came out to-night I didn&rsquo;t mean to go back
any more,&rdquo; she said. Her voice was low and full of a
weary bitterness. &ldquo;I was so unhappy I didn&rsquo;t want to live.&rdquo;
She caught her breath. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for
you&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she was looking at him now with shame in her
eyes. &ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you I shouldn&rsquo;t have gone
back&ndash;&ndash;ever&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;But now....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; said Micky as she paused, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re going
back, and we&rsquo;re going to start the new year&ndash;&ndash;friends,
you and I! Is that a bargain?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside Micky hailed a taxicab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re much too tired to walk,&rdquo; he said when she
protested. &ldquo;And it will be a new experience for Charlie,&rdquo;
he added with a twinkle.</p>
<p>He put her into the cab, and stood for a moment at
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the address?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She hesitated, looking away from him; then suddenly
she told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Brixton Road&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s a very horrid boarding-house,&rdquo;
she added with a half-sigh.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Boarding-houses are all horrid,&rdquo; said Micky cheerily.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll come down myself to-morrow and see how
bad it really is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to see her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall you be in if I come in the afternoon?&rdquo; he
asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About four, then,&rdquo; said Micky. He groped for her
hand, found it, and pressed it. &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the next moment Micky was alone in the starlight.</p>
<p>He stood looking after the taxi with a queer sense
of unreality. Had he just dreamt it all, and was there
really no such girl as Esther Shepstone? No Charlie?
He shook himself together with a laugh. Of course it
was real, all of it! He walked on soberly through the
cold night.</p>
<p>To-morrow he would go to the very horrid boarding-house
in the Brixton Road and see her again.</p>
<p>Esther! He liked her name; there was something
quaint and old-world about it. It seemed impossible that
they had only met a few hours ago.</p>
<p>His headache had quite vanished. He was whistling
a snatch of song when he let himself into the house
and went upstairs.</p>
<p>He opened the door of his sitting-room, and then
stopped dead on the threshold. The lights were burning
fully, and a man was ensconced in his favourite armchair
by the fire&ndash;&ndash;Ashton. Lord! he had forgotten all
about Ashton.</p>
<p>Micky looked guiltily at the clock&ndash;&ndash;nearly eleven!&ndash;&ndash;he
began a half-apology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awfully sorry, old man&ndash;&ndash;I was kept.... Been
waiting long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got here at ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashton climbed out of the chair and looked at Micky
with a sort of shamefacedness.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take your coat off,&rdquo; he said suddenly. &ldquo;I want
you to come out again&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out! Now! Look at the time, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s only eleven.... I&rsquo;m catching the
midnight to Dover....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dover! What in the world....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashton turned round and looked down at the fire with
a sort of embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the mater,&rdquo; he said jerkily. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s found out&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found out! What on earth....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashton made an impatient gesture. He was a good-looking
man, with dark eyes that could look all manner
of things without in the least meaning them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that girl at Eldred&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said in a strangled
voice. &ldquo;You know! I told you about her. Lord, man,
don&rsquo;t look so confoundedly ignorant! I told you about
her,&rdquo; he broke off. &ldquo;Well, some one&rsquo;s told the mater,
and this morning....&rdquo; he shrugged his shoulders.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been old Harry to pay! She told me if I didn&rsquo;t
give her up she&rsquo;d cut me out of her will. She would,
too!&rdquo; he added, in savage parenthesis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! and what did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashton looked round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it all! what could I say? Told her I would, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sharp silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you liked the girl,&rdquo; said Micky bluntly.</p>
<p>The other man winced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did&ndash;&ndash;so I do.... It&rsquo;s a rotten shame. If
you&rsquo;d ever seen her ... you never have, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither has the mater.... Women are all the
same; because the girl has to work for her living they
think she isn&rsquo;t fit for me to marry.... It&rsquo;s all a lot
of rot.... However&ndash;&ndash;beggars can&rsquo;t be choosers&ndash;&ndash;and
so I&rsquo;m off to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>Micky looked at him keenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that you&rsquo;re going without a word to the
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do?&ndash;&ndash;I went and saw her this morning&ndash;&ndash;we
had a rotten scene. I meant to tell her it was all
up, but somehow I couldn&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;m too dashed fond of her,
and that&rsquo;s the truth. I can&rsquo;t bear to see her cry&ndash;&ndash;it
makes me feel such a cur....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited a moment, but Micky made no comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the only thing is to clear out,&rdquo; Ashton went on
jerkily. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford to quarrel with the mater, you
know that.... Perhaps some day....&rdquo; He
stopped. &ldquo;After all, she can&rsquo;t live for ever,&rdquo; he added
brutally.</p>
<p>Micky said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;m off to-night,&rdquo; Ashton went on with an effort.
&ldquo;I wanted to see you&ndash;&ndash;I knew I could trust you....&rdquo;
He fumbled in a pocket. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a letter here....
I&rsquo;ve written&ndash;&ndash;I couldn&rsquo;t see her again. I know I&rsquo;m a
coward, but ... well, there it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw the letter down on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go and see her, old chap, and give her
that?&rdquo; he asked with an effort. &ldquo;Tell her I&ndash;&ndash;oh, tell
her what you like,&rdquo; he went on fiercely. &ldquo;Tell her that
if I could afford it....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped again, and this time the silence was unbroken
for some minutes.</p>
<p>Then he roused himself and picked up his coat. &ldquo;Well,
I must be getting along. I left my baggage at the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at Micky. &ldquo;I suppose you think I&rsquo;m an infernal
sweep, eh?&rdquo; he asked curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Micky.</p>
<p>He had always expected that Ashton&rsquo;s romance would
end like this, and he felt vaguely sorry for the girl,
though he had never seen her. She must have expected
it, too, he thought. She must have known Ashton&rsquo;s position
all along. He followed his friend out of the room.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me her address,&rdquo; he said suddenly.</p>
<p>He decided that it would be better to send the letter&ndash;&ndash;he
did not want to see her. He hated a scene as much
as Ashton did.</p>
<p>Ashton was at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on the letter. What have you done with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an irritable note in his voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave
it lying there for that man of yours to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky went back into the room. The letter lay on
the table where Ashton had thrown it down.</p>
<p>He picked it up, glancing casually at the written address
as he did so. Then suddenly his tall figure stiffened,
and a curiously blank look filled his eyes, for the
name scribbled there in Ashton&rsquo;s writing was&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Esther Shepstone,&rdquo; and, below it, the number
of the very horrid boarding-house in the Brixton Road.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_II' id='CHAPTER_II'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>Micky stood staring at the envelope in his hand.
He felt as if something had happened to paralyse
all power of action.</p>
<p>Esther Shepstone and Ashton&rsquo;s girl from Eldred&rsquo;s were
one and the same; that was all he could grasp, and it
sounded absurd and impossible.</p>
<p>He had heard so much of this girl&ndash;&ndash;Ashton had talked
about her times without number&ndash;&ndash;Lallie he had called
her; now he came to think of it, Micky could not remember
having ever heard her spoken of by any other name;
and Lallie and Esther Shepstone were one and the same.</p>
<p>Was this, then, why she had cried, because of Ashton...?</p>
<p>Ashton called to him impatiently from the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce are you doing? I shall miss my
train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky roused himself with a start, and, dropping the
letter into his pocket, went slowly out of the room; he
felt as if he could not have hurried had his life depended
upon it; there was an absurdly cold sort of feeling round
his heart.</p>
<p>It was ridiculous, of course; it was nothing to him
if the girl with whom he had dined an hour ago loved
Ashton; he had never seen her before. That sounded
an absurd truth, too; it seemed impossible that until this
evening he and she had never met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, hurry up, man,&rdquo; said Ashton again
sharply.</p>
<p>He was at the bottom of the stairs; the face he turned
over his shoulder to Micky looked pale and harassed.</p>
<p>Micky quickened his steps and joined his friend in the
porch below; they stood together out on the path waiting
for a taxicab.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>Micky glanced at Ashton with a curious sense of unreality;
he felt as if he had never seen him before; it
seemed impossible that this Ashton could know Esther&ndash;&ndash;and
Charlie!</p>
<p>A taxicab drew up to the kerb; Ashton banged open
the door and got in. Micky followed, and they drove
some way in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take thundering good care I don&rsquo;t stay away
long,&rdquo; Ashton said suddenly, with a sort of growl. &ldquo;And
if the mater thinks it will make me forget Lallie&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought her name was Esther,&rdquo; said Micky quietly.
He was looking out of the window into the starry night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is&ndash;&ndash;but I always call her Lallie.&rdquo; He looked
at his friend with a sort of vague suspicion. &ldquo;How do
you know what her name is?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it on the letter you gave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashton grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be better if you posted it to her
yourself and have done with it,&rdquo; Micky said with an
effort. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a rotten hand at this sort of thing. It can&rsquo;t
do any good if I go and see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you would go&ndash;&ndash;you might be a sport and
stick to your word,&rdquo; Ashton protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do the
same for you any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky rather doubted it, but did not like to say so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you knew how sick I am about the whole business,&rdquo;
Ashton went on jerkily. &ldquo;You may not believe
me, but I tell you, Micky, that I&rsquo;d marry that girl to-morrow
if only&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only&ndash;&ndash;what?&rdquo; Micky asked as he paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know! What the dickens can I do without
a bob to my name except what the mater chooses to
dole out? I tell you,&rdquo; he went on with a sort of snarl,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be very different when I get the money. Gad! if
only I&rsquo;d got it now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money isn&rsquo;t everything,&rdquo; said Micky sententiously.
&ldquo;And if you like the girl, why not marry her and face
it out?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></div>
<p>Ashton gave a savage little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very fine for you to say that money isn&rsquo;t
everything&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s only because you&rsquo;ve got it, and are
never likely to be without it. You don&rsquo;t know what it
feels like to be up to your eyes in debt and not knowing
where to turn for a fiver. Bah! what&rsquo;s the good of
talking?&rdquo; He let down the window with a run, turning
his face to the keen night air.</p>
<p>They were nearing their destination, and there was
still something he wanted to say to Micky which so far,
he had been afraid to put into words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I shan&rsquo;t be seeing you again for a
bit,&rdquo; he said, with rather a forced laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been
a good pal to me, Micky&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky said &ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; rather shortly; he frowned in the
darkness; Ashton got on his nerves; he rather wished
he had not come to see him off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you have&ndash;&ndash;whether you like me to say so
or not,&rdquo; the other man went on obstinately. &ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;and
there&rsquo;s one last thing I&rsquo;m going to ask you before I
go....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited, but Micky did not speak.</p>
<p>The taxi was turning into the station yard now, moving
slowly because of the congested traffic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could give Lallie some money,&rdquo; Ashton went
on with a rush. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d send her some, but I&rsquo;ve only just
got enough to get out of the way with. I&rsquo;ll pay you
back as soon as the mater condescends to send me another
cheque....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky&rsquo;s face felt hot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she&ndash;&ndash;hasn&rsquo;t she got any, then?&rdquo; he asked with
an effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;at least I promised her some when I saw her
this morning. She&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s left Eldred&rsquo;s. You see&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he
drew a hard breath&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;you see, I hoped we&rsquo;d be able to
get married, and so&ndash;&ndash;well, there was no sense in her staying
on there. She was worked to death, poor kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced at Micky, but could not see his face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You understand, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said, encouraged by
his silence. &ldquo;She owes them a bit at the boarding-house
where she is living. I promised to wipe it off for her,
but the mater cutting up rough altered everything, and
so ... if you could give her a little&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to it,&rdquo; said Micky. He opened the door of
the taxi and got out before it was at a standstill. He
took off his hat and let the cold air play on his hot
forehead. He could hardly trust himself to speak.</p>
<p>He was thankful when Ashton went off to see to his
luggage. He walked into the station and found himself
aimlessly staring at a notice board. He could not remember
when he had felt so furiously angry.</p>
<p>Had Ashton changed? he was asking himself in bewilderment.
Or was it merely that he had never seen
the man he really was until to-night?</p>
<p>He tried to remember what Ashton had told him about
Esther Shepstone in the past. That she had been at
Eldred&rsquo;s he knew, and that Eldred&rsquo;s was a place where
women bought silk petticoats and things he also knew.
He had heard Marie Deland and her friends talking
about it lots of times. Marie had once invited him to
accompany her there when they had been out together,
but he had refused and had waited outside for her. Now
he came to think of it, that was about all Ashton had
ever told him of Esther Shepstone.</p>
<p>He knew that Ashton had been seen about with her a
great deal; knew that he had had to stand a lot of harmless
chaff in consequence; he himself had joked about
Ashton&rsquo;s &ldquo;latest&rdquo; as they had all called her: it seemed a
memory to be ashamed of, when he thought of the way
he had heard her sobbing in the street that night, of the
distress in her eyes, of the hopeless way in which she
had spoken.</p>
<p>Ashton rejoined him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buck up! The train&rsquo;s in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went along the platform, followed by a porter
with Ashton&rsquo;s baggage. Micky looked at it resentfully;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
Ashton was evidently prepared to enjoy himself; this was
no rush after mere solitude and forgetfulness.</p>
<p>He stood stiffly at the carriage door while Ashton
stowed his smaller traps on the rack. Presently he came
to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do the best you can, won&rsquo;t you, old man?&rdquo;
There was a real anxiety in his eyes, but Micky was not
looking at him; he answered stiffly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll do what I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll soon get another job,&rdquo; Ashton went on, with
forced confidence. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry she left Eldred&rsquo;s, now it&rsquo;s
come to this, but how was I to know?&rdquo; he appealed to
Micky, but he might as well have appealed to a brick
wall for all response he got.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I come back&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;Tell
her that when I come back many things may be all right
again ... tell her that, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her,&rdquo; said Micky stolidly.</p>
<p>The guard was blowing his whistle now, doors were
being shut.</p>
<p>Micky roused himself and looked at his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;are you going to write to her?&rdquo; he
asked constrainedly.</p>
<p>Ashton coloured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s better not&ndash;&ndash;far better let the thing drop till
I come back. I&rsquo;ve explained it all in my letter&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;ll understand.
It&rsquo;s no use writing&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s better
not&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky hunched his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your affair,&rdquo; he said laconically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, well, I shan&rsquo;t write&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll send you my address
as soon as I know where I&rsquo;m staying, and you can let
me know what she said and how she takes it....
Oh, confound it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A porter had come along and slammed the door; the
train was slowly moving; Micky was vaguely glad that
there had been no time in which to shake hands. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
moment, and he was walking away alone down the platform.</p>
<p>His hands were deep thrust in the pockets of his coat;
he took no notice of anything; he walked on and out
of the station.</p>
<p>Well, this had been an eventful New Year&rsquo;s Eve with a
vengeance; he glanced up at the clock in the dome behind
him&ndash;&ndash;only a quarter to twelve now, and yet so much
had been crowded into the past four hours. Since the
moment when the Delands rang up to cancel his engagement
to dine he seemed to have stepped out of the
old world into a new. He wondered what Esther Shepstone
was doing in the very horrid boarding-house of
which she had told him&ndash;&ndash;if she was thinking of Ashton.</p>
<p>What a cad the man was, what a cad!&ndash;&ndash;he was amazed
that he had not discovered it before&ndash;&ndash;to clear off and
leave a girl like this, without a word of farewell except
the letter. He wondered if he meant to deliver it and
admit that he knew Ashton, or if he meant just to stick
a stamp on and post it to her.</p>
<p>He realised that there was nothing very much to be
proud of in an admission that he knew Ashton, and yet
they had been friends for years.</p>
<p>It was striking twelve when he got home; he stood for
a moment on the doorstep, looking up at the starry sky.</p>
<p>Several clocks were chiming midnight in the distance;
he listened with a queer sense of fatalism.</p>
<p>This was the strangest New Year&rsquo;s Eve he had ever
spent in his life. At this hour last year he had been
dancing the old year out, and to-night, had things gone
as he had thought, he would have been somewhere with
Marie Deland&ndash;&ndash;he might even have proposed to her by
this time. He smiled faintly, remembering that the intention
had really been somewhere in the background
of his mind; but that, too, had faded out now to give
place to other, more important, factors.</p>
<p>Nine, ten, eleven, twelve! He counted the strokes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
mechanically; there was a breathless pause, then the clash
of bells.</p>
<p>Some irrepressibles in a block of flats near by raised a
cheer; the front door of a house opposite was open, and
Micky caught a glimpse of a crowded hall and black-coated
men and girls in pretty frocks.</p>
<p>He felt strangely removed from all the noise and laughter;
after a moment he turned and went up to his room.</p>
<p>The fire had been carefully made up and his slippers
and dressing-gown put to warm. Micky looked at them
with a sort of disgust; it was sickening for a healthy
grown man to be so pampered; he kicked the slippers
into a corner and tossed the dressing-gown on to the
couch.</p>
<p>He wondered what sort of a room Esther Shepstone
had in the very horrid boarding-house&ndash;&ndash;what odd corner
the thin black cat curled into to sleep.</p>
<p>He took Ashton&rsquo;s letter from his pocket and stuck it
up against the clock on the mantelshelf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Esther Shepstone....&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was fate, that&rsquo;s what it was! He wondered if she
would ever have lived to get that letter had fate not
thrown her across his path that night.</p>
<p>She had been desperate&ndash;&ndash;at the end of her tether, and
all for the sake of that cad Ashton.</p>
<p>He turned his back on the letter and lit a cigarette, but
he let it go out almost at once, and turned back again
to stare once more at the name scrawled on the envelope.</p>
<p>What had Ashton written to her? It worried him because
he did not know. Ashton had had other love-affairs&ndash;&ndash;not
quite such serious ones, perhaps, but still serious
enough&ndash;&ndash;and Micky knew that when he had wearied
of them he had set about getting free of them by the
shortest route, caring little if it were also a brutal one.
He thought of the despair he had seen in Esther&rsquo;s face
that evening; he dreaded that there might be something
in Ashton&rsquo;s farewell letter that would plunge her back
more deeply into her misery.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>Out in the night the bells were still ringing joyously.</p>
<p>It was New Year&rsquo;s morning, and perhaps, if he sent
that letter ... He stood quite still for a moment,
staring at it; then suddenly he threw his cigarette into
the fire and snatched the letter down from the shelf.</p>
<p>He tore it open impulsively and drew out the enclosure.
He unfolded it and began to read. The silence of
the room was unbroken save for the little crisp sound
as Micky turned the paper; then the letter fluttered to
the rug at his feet and lay there, half-curled up, as if it
were ashamed of the words it bore and wished to hide
them.</p>
<p>Micky raised his eyes and looked at his reflection in
the glass above the mantelshelf. The pallor of his face
surprised him, and the look of passionate anger in his
eyes.</p>
<p>He was a man of the world. He was no better and
no worse than many of the men whom he knew and
called his friends, but this letter, in its brutal callousness,
seemed to shame his very manhood.</p>
<p>He had liked Ashton, had been his constant companion
for months, but he had never suspected him of being
capable of this.</p>
<p>He supposed he ought to be ashamed of having opened
the letter, but he was not ashamed; he was glad that he
had been able to spare the girl this last and hardest
blow of all&ndash;&ndash;the knowledge that the man whom she loved
and trusted was unworthy.</p>
<p>Presently he picked the letter up from the rug. He
picked it up with the tips of his fingers, as if it were
something repulsive to him, and threw it down on the
table.</p>
<p>The first few words stared up at him as it lay there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Dear Lallie</span>,&ndash;&ndash;By the time you get this letter I shall be out of
England, and I hope you won&rsquo;t make things worse for me than
they already are by trying to find out where I have gone or by
writing to my people and making a scene. The worst of these
little flirtations is that they always have to end, as this must, and
you must have known it.&rdquo;...</p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>Micky drew in his breath hard; not an hour ago in
this very room Ashton had made out how cut-up he was
at the turn his affairs had taken, and yet all the time he
had written this letter.</p>
<p>He flicked over a page and read on:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;... I shall never forget you and the good times we&rsquo;ve had
together. I should try and get back at Eldred&rsquo;s, if I were you.
It&rsquo;s a good thing we didn&rsquo;t get married as matters have turned
out, or the fat would have been in the fire with a vengeance. As
it is, I shall have all my work cut out to put the mater in a good
temper again. I am sending you some money by Mickey Mellowes;
he&rsquo;s a friend of mine and as rich as Cr&oelig;sus, and as
selfish as the devil. If he offers to take you out, let him, by all
means. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad thing if he took a fancy to you; he
doesn&rsquo;t care a hang for any one but himself. If only I&rsquo;d got half
his money ... but what&rsquo;s the use of talking about it? Anyway,
this is good-bye; I shan&rsquo;t write again. Be a sensible girl,
and try to see things from my point of view. It would only have
meant ruin for both of us if I&rsquo;d stuck to you. Good-bye; I send
you my love for the last time.</p>
<p class='ralign'><span class='smcap'>Raymond Ashton</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this from the man whom she loved; the man who
had pretended to love her!</p>
<p>Micky dragged forward a chair with his foot and sat
down straddlewise. He leaned an elbow on the chair-back
and ran his fingers through his hair with a sort of
bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as rich as Cr&oelig;sus and as selfish as the devil....&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this from Ashton, his friend&ndash;&ndash;the man whom he
had helped out of scrapes scores of times; the man to
whom he had lent money without the least hope of its
ever being returned; Micky felt as if he had a blow in
the face.</p>
<p>His thoughts were in a whirl; the whole world needed
readjusting. Was he selfish? he asked himself in perplexity&ndash;&ndash;if
so, it was quite unconsciously, and anyway
Ashton was the last person who should have made the
accusation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sending you some money by a friend of
mine....&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>There was no hint that the money was first to be borrowed;
he had evidently been sure of his prey; Micky
swore under his breath.</p>
<p>Of course, Ashton had not dreamed of the letter being
opened, had not dreamed of anything but that his carefully-made
plans would be minutely carried out and nothing
more said.</p>
<p>Micky sat for a long time, lost in thought; the hands
of the clock crawled round to one and the chime struck;
he looked up then, glancing at the clock vaguely.</p>
<p>If he had not met Esther Shepstone there might have
been no Esther in the world at all now; if he allowed
that letter to reach its destination he would be plunging
her back again into the abyss of despair from which he
had dragged her only that evening. She loved Ashton; of
that Micky was sure. Very well then, she should at least
have some part of her ideal left to her.</p>
<p>He went over to his desk and took up paper and pen;
he spread Ashton&rsquo;s letter out before him and studied the
writing carefully.</p>
<p>Ordinary sort of writing, rather unformed and sprawly,
but after a trial run Micky managed a very presentable
copy of it.</p>
<p>He sat back in his chair and eyed his handiwork with
pride; he had missed his vocation, he told himself with a
chuckle; he ought to have been a forger.</p>
<p>Then he dipped the pen in the ink again and squared
his elbows. He had never written a love-letter in his life,
but he knew positively that he was about to write one
now.</p>
<p>He thought of Esther and the wistfulness of her grey
eyes; she was the girl whom a man could love. He coloured
a little as the thought involuntarily crossed his
mind; she was a girl whom&ndash;&ndash;he began to write rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling little girl&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky was naturally rather eloquent with his pen,
though he had never before tried it in this especial direction.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;This is the most difficult letter I have ever had to
write in all my life; first, because I love you so much;
and, secondly, because I am afraid it is going to hurt you
nearly as much as it hurts me. Dear, as it will be some
time before I see you again, and because I cannot explain
everything to you, I am going to ask you to trust
me till we meet again. I am leaving England to-night....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky paused and ran his fingers through his hair
agitatedly before he struggled on once more: &ldquo;I shall
be thinking of you every minute till we meet again, and
of the happy times we have had together. I will write
to you whenever I can....&rdquo; The pen paused, and
Micky groaned, recalling that Ashton had said he should
not write at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll have to do, anyway,&rdquo; he muttered, and again the
pen flew: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much of a hand at writing letters,
as you know, but you must try and read between the
lines, and guess at all I would say were we together
... All I will say to you when we meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That last sentence was rather neat, Micky thought with
pride, then a wave of compunction swept through his
heart as he remembered the tragedy behind it all, and he
finished the page soberly enough: &ldquo;Ever yours, Raymond
Ashton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn him!&rdquo; said Micky under his breath, as he blotted
the signature; then he took two ten-pound notes from
a drawer in his desk, and, enclosing them in the envelope,
sealed and stamped it.</p>
<p>It was half-past one, but Micky climbed into his coat
again. He locked Ashton&rsquo;s letter into his desk, and, taking
the one he had written, went quietly down to the
street.</p>
<p>The world was sleeping and deserted, and Micky&rsquo;s footsteps
echoed hollowly along the pavement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool, you know!&rdquo; he told himself, with a
sort of humour. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bally fool, my boy! It won&rsquo;t
end here, you see if it does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he went on to the pillar-box at the street corner.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>When he reached it he stood for a moment with the
letter in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool,&rdquo; he told himself again hardily. &ldquo;Micky,
my boy, you&rsquo;re a bally idiot, interfering with what doesn&rsquo;t
concern you&ndash;&ndash;with what doesn&rsquo;t concern you in the very
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at the stars and thought of Esther Shepstone,
of her eyes and her wavering smile, and the soft
note in her voice as she had asked him&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you always as kind to every one as you have
been to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No concern of his! It was every concern of his; he
knew that he was only living for the hours to pass before
he saw her again. No concern of his! when the greatest
miracle of all the world had come to pass during those
last hours of the old year, inasmuch that Micky Mellowes,
heartwhole and a bachelor for thirty odd years,
had been bowled over by a girl without a shilling to her
name&ndash;&ndash;a girl who loved another man, but a girl to whom
Micky had without wishing it, without knowing it, dedicated
the rest of his life!</p>
<p>He was her champion for the future, some one to
stand between her and the callousness of the man of
whom even now she was probably thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No concern of mine!&rdquo; said Micky to himself with fine
scorn. &ldquo;Why, of course it is! Every concern of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He squared his shoulders and dropped the envelope
into the pillar-box.</p>
<p>And so Micky Mellowes posted his first love-letter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p>In spite of the events of the night Micky Mellowes
slept soundly. It was half-past nine when he woke,
to find his man Driver moving noiselessly about the
room.</p>
<p>When he saw that Micky was awake he approached
the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, sir, and a happy New Year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driver had an expressionless voice; he announced tea
or tragedy in exactly the same tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Micky vacantly; the words opened the door
of memory, and he sat up with a start. It was New
Year&rsquo;s Day, and last night ... ye gods! what had
not happened last night? Micky tingled to the tips of
his fingers as he remembered the letter he had written
and posted; he had expected to feel rotten about it in
the light of day; it was an agreeable surprise to find
that he did not feel anything of the kind.</p>
<p>When he went in to breakfast there was a pile of letters
waiting for him; he looked them through carelessly&ndash;&ndash;there
was one from Marie Deland, which he opened
with a vague feeling of nervousness.</p>
<p>Marie was a nice little girl; he really was quite fond
of her, and yet ... surely the days of miracles had
not yet passed away, seeing that in a few short hours
his feeling for her had changed from something warmer
to more brotherly affection.</p>
<p>It made him feel uncomfortable to read what she had
written; it was really only quite an ordinary letter of
regret that she had not seen him last night, but Micky
imagined he could read more between the lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... I quite hoped you would drop in, if only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
for a few moments,&rdquo; so she wrote. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so dull.
I am writing this alone in the library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky knew that library well; he and she had spent a
good deal of time there together talking sweet nothings;
he wondered if he would have been an engaged man by
this time if that relative of the Delands had not so conveniently
died, and if Esther had not chosen his particular
street in which to weep.</p>
<p>He screwed the letter up and tossed it into the fire;
he would answer it some time, or call; there was no immediate
hurry. When he had finished his breakfast he
went to his locked desk and took out Ashton&rsquo;s letter&ndash;&ndash;somehow
until he actually saw it again he could not quite
believe that the events of last night had not all been a
dream; but the letter was real enough, at all events with
its callous beginning to &ldquo;Dear Lallie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The morning seemed to drag; twice people rang him
up on the &rsquo;phone and asked him to lunch, but Micky
was not in the mood for lunch; he felt a suppressed sort
of excitement, as if something of great import were
about to happen.</p>
<p>Driver looked at him woodenly once or twice; his face
was as expressionless as his voice, but his dull eyes saw
everything, and behind them his keen brain wondered
what had happened to make Micky so restless.</p>
<p>Towards one o&rsquo;clock he ventured a gentle reminder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have an engagement for half-past three, sir&ndash;&ndash;Miss
Langdon&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky was yawning over the paper then; he looked up
with an absurdly blank face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say!&ndash;&ndash;well, I can&rsquo;t go, anyway. What was it
for? I&rsquo;m going out&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve got an important appointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driver never showed surprise at anything if he felt it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a musical &lsquo;At &rsquo;Ome,&rsquo; sir,&rdquo; he answered stolidly.
&ldquo;Shall I ring up and say that you won&rsquo;t be able to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ring up,&rdquo; said Micky. He coloured self-consciously
beneath the man&rsquo;s stoic eyes and hurriedly buried
his head again in the newspaper.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></div>
<p>At three o&rsquo;clock he changed his clothes for an immaculate
morning-coat and grey trousers; then, remembering
what Esther had said about the very horrid boarding-house,
he changed them again for the oldest tweed suit
in his possession, and a pair of brown boots that had
seen their best days and long since been condemned by
Driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world do I get to Brixton?&rdquo; Micky asked
the man when he was ready. &ldquo;I know I could take a
taxicab, but I don&rsquo;t want to. What other ways are
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driver told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the train, sir, or a tram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky jumped at the tramcar. He was sure that people
who lived in Brixton must all use tramcars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long would a tramcar take?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Driver considered. Finally he said that he thought it
might be the best part of an hour.</p>
<p>Micky glanced at the clock. It was already a quarter
past three. He took up his hat hurriedly and went out
into the street.</p>
<p>A taxicab would have to do for to-day anyway. He
could dismiss it at the corner of the road and walk the
last few yards. A moment later he was being whirled
through the streets.</p>
<p>He sat leaning back in the corner with his feet up on
the seat opposite, feeling decidedly nervous.</p>
<p>Supposing he did not see Esther&ndash;&ndash;supposing she were
not there? Supposing she had purposely given him the
wrong address? Supposing ... oh, supposing a
thousand and one things! Micky was full of apprehension
when at last the taxicab stopped at the corner of
the Brixton Road and the driver came to the door to
ask what number.</p>
<p>Micky scrambled out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll walk the rest of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paid the man liberally, and set out along the
crowded pathway. There were so many people about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
that he thought it must be a market day or something.
A word with a policeman elicited the information that he
was at quite the wrong end of the street for the number
he wanted. Micky was rather glad. He felt that he
needed time in which to collect his thoughts, and yet
when at last he reached his destination he felt as nervous
as a kitten and strongly inclined to go back. But he
went on and up the bare strip of garden which led to
the front door of the house. It wasn&rsquo;t such a bad-looking
house, he thought. Not nearly as bad as he had expected
from the girl&rsquo;s description. In fact, once upon a time it
must have been rather a palatial residence, but all the
windows now were boxed up with cheap, starchy-looking
curtains, and there was a sort of third-rate atmosphere
about the basement and the cheap knocker on the front
door.</p>
<p>Micky looked for a bell, but there wasn&rsquo;t one, so he
knocked.</p>
<p>It seemed a long time before anybody came. When
at last they did he heard them coming for a long time
before the door was opened, heard slipshod steps on shiny
linoleum, and a husky sort of breathless cough.</p>
<p>The owner of the cough was young and scared-looking,
in shoes several sizes too large for her, and a skirt several
inches too short. When Micky asked for Miss Shepstone
she stared without answering for a moment, then she
turned and slopped back the way she had come, leaving
the door on the chain.</p>
<p>Micky chuckled to himself; she evidently did not like
the look of him.</p>
<p>He waited patiently; then he heard another step along
the shiny linoleumed floor of the hall&ndash;&ndash;a very different
step this time&ndash;&ndash;and, turning eagerly, he saw Esther herself
in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really think you would come,&rdquo; she said breathlessly.</p>
<p>For a moment Micky could not find his tongue. If
he had thought this girl pretty last night with the tears
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
in her eyes he thought her a thousand times prettier now.
She looked as if some magician hand had wiped the distress
from her face and convinced her that the sun still
shone.</p>
<p>She wore the same clothes she had worn last night, but
even they seemed somehow to have changed. There was
a bunch of violets pinned in her jacket. Micky wondered
if it were the violets that were responsible for the
alteration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I make an appointment I always keep it,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>He had almost added &ldquo;with any one like you,&rdquo; but
thought better of it. &ldquo;And are you going to let me take
you out to tea?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She hesitated; she glanced back into the dingy hall
behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am leaving here to-day,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My box has
gone already. If you will wait a moment ... I
would ask you in, but you&rsquo;d hate it so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait outside,&rdquo; said Micky.</p>
<p>He went down into the street. For the moment he
had quite forgotten all about Ashton and the letter which
must by this time be in Esther&rsquo;s possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about Charlie?&rdquo; he asked whimsically when
she joined him.</p>
<p>She smiled, shaking her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent him on&ndash;&ndash;in a basket. Nobody wants him here&ndash;&ndash;he
only gets badgered about all day long; so I&rsquo;m taking
him with me. Do you think I ought not to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Charlie is a most fortunate cat,&rdquo; said Micky.</p>
<p>She did not take him seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he will be happier with me anyway,&rdquo; she said
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to quite a nice boarding-house now. I went
out this morning and found it.&rdquo; She looked up at him
with a smile. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think even you would mind coming
to tea there,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to say mind coming there
to live,&rdquo; Micky told her audaciously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
about for fresh diggings; I&rsquo;m tired of mine.&rdquo; He stopped
and glanced behind him. &ldquo;Can we get a tramcar here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not tired,&rdquo; she said quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must admit that I am,&rdquo; Micky answered. He
hated walking at the best of times, and he did not like
to suggest another taxicab. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go on top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They climbed up and found a front seat; there was a
working man next to them smoking shag in a clay pipe;
he looked at Micky and Esther doubtfully, then asked&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does your good lady mind smoke, mister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind at all,&rdquo; she said, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got home all right last night, then?&rdquo; Micky said
presently. &ldquo;After you had gone I wished I had seen you
safely in....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of you, but I was quite all right.&rdquo; There
was a note of constraint in her voice. &ldquo;I should like to
thank you for what you did for me last night,&rdquo; she said
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you....&rdquo; She stopped.</p>
<p>Micky did not know what to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s all right now, eh?&rdquo; he asked presently,
with awkward cheerfulness. &ldquo;I thought it would be;
when things look so black that they can&rsquo;t possibly look
any blacker, they always begin to mend. I&rsquo;ve found that
out before; I don&rsquo;t know if you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it out this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky looked down at her. She was sitting with her
hands clasped together in her lap; there was a little flush
in her cheeks, and her lips were curved into a faint
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so wonderful too,&rdquo; she went on softly, &ldquo;that
it should have happened on New Year&rsquo;s Day&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fares, all fares, please,&rdquo; said the conductor beside
them. Micky dived into a pocket and found a shilling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two, please,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He had paid for and shared taxicabs with Marie Deland
times without number, but it had never given him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
quite the same pleasurable little thrill as he experienced
at this moment.</p>
<p>There was something so pleasantly familiar about this
tramcar ride, the fact of sharing the same uncomfortable
seat with Esther Shepstone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny ones?&rdquo; the conductor asked.</p>
<p>Micky looked at the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall we get off?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penny ones will do,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Micky took the tickets and pocketed his change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if there are any decent teashops round
here,&rdquo; he said dubiously. &ldquo;If you would rather go up to
the West End....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But finally they found a confectioner&rsquo;s quite close to
where the penny fare ended.</p>
<p>Micky looked round critically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this all right?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been here
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, often,&rdquo; she said. She was drawing off her
gloves.</p>
<p>Micky glanced hurriedly at her hands; she was wearing
a ring. Hardly knowing that he did so, he leaned across
and touched it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that an engagement ring?&rdquo; he asked. His voice
sounded a little breathless.</p>
<p>She looked up at him, drawing her hand away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew back; he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon. I suppose I have no right to
ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ordered tea. He talked rather forced platitudes
for the rest of the time. He was just going to call for
the bill, when Esther Shepstone said suddenly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mellowes, I should like to tell you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Micky did not look at her. Somehow he could
not trust himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t in the least know why I want to tell you,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
she said again nervously. &ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ve been so kind to
me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Micky gently, as she paused. &ldquo;Yes, what
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was twisting her teaspoon, and she kept her eyes
lowered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night, when I met you&ndash;&ndash;I was very unhappy ...
There didn&rsquo;t seem anything to live for in the world....
I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever felt like that, or if you have
ever cared for any one&ndash;&ndash;really cared, I mean&ndash;&ndash;but if
you have....&rdquo; She stopped again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I understand,&rdquo; Micky said, with an effort.
&ldquo;You mean that there&rsquo;s some one, some man....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised her grey eyes to his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some man you care for&ndash;&ndash;care for very much,&rdquo; Micky
went on slowly. &ldquo;Perhaps some one you have quarreled
with&ndash;&ndash;who hadn&rsquo;t been quite as ... kind as he
might have been&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soft colour flooded her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you guess&ndash;&ndash;last night?&rdquo; she asked shyly.</p>
<p>Micky smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I? I am not sure, perhaps.&rdquo; He drew a long
breath that was half a sigh. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I am telling you this&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she said
again, with a sort of distress. &ldquo;It cannot interest you,
but, somehow, I think I should like you to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It interests me very much&ndash;&ndash;I am honoured that you
should tell me.&rdquo; Micky looked again at the ring she
wore; quite a cheap little ring, with a couple of inferior
diamonds. &ldquo;You mean that you are engaged to be married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; at least&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; The words were only a whisper.</p>
<p>Micky sat very still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose you will have me for a friend all the
same, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked with an effort.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>She looked at him in faint amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought if I told you that perhaps you&rsquo;d rather
not....&rdquo; She stopped in confusion.</p>
<p>Micky leaned a little closer over the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said last night that you didn&rsquo;t believe in a man&rsquo;s
friendship for a woman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, I am going to
make you believe in it. I&rsquo;m going to be your friend.
The fact that you are engaged makes no difference to
me, if it doesn&rsquo;t to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m very glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. I suppose I mustn&rsquo;t ask who the&ndash;&ndash;the
lucky man is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you. And he&rsquo;s away now&ndash;&ndash;out of England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice changed a little, her eyes looked past Micky
as if for the moment she had forgotten him.</p>
<p>Micky watched her jealously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so whatever was wrong last night is all right
to-day, is that it?&rdquo; he asked with an effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes ... somehow I never thought it would be,
but this morning&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning?&rdquo; he echoed as she stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a letter this morning,&rdquo; she told him, and her
voice had softened so wonderfully that Micky caught his
breath. &ldquo;Oh, I wonder if you have ever been as unhappy
as I was last night, and then had a letter, a wonderful
letter like I had this morning? There was something
in it that seemed to put everything right straight away;
something that I&rsquo;ve always wanted before and never had.
I can&rsquo;t explain it any better than that, but perhaps you
understand. I&rsquo;m just telling you because I feel so happy
I must tell somebody, and because I didn&rsquo;t want you to
misjudge him as I did yesterday. I thought he didn&rsquo;t
really care, and I wanted to die, but to-day, when his letter
came&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She broke off into a little happy laugh.</p>
<p>Micky had rammed his clenched hands into his pockets;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
the blood was hammering in his temples; his brain
felt in a whirl; somehow in all his wildest imaginings
he had never dreamed of this.</p>
<p>It was his letter that had brought that new look of
happiness to her eyes! His letter which perhaps even
then lay against her heart; the first love-letter he had
ever written to any woman, and she believed it to have
been written by Raymond Ashton!</p>
<p>He did not realise how long he sat there without speaking
till Esther spoke to him again. There was a little
anxious note in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve bored you horribly with all this. I
know it&rsquo;s no interest to you, but I felt that I must tell
somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky roused himself with an effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s of great interest to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And you
mustn&rsquo;t ever say a thing like that again. We&rsquo;re going to
be friends, and real friends are always interested in
everything that concerns the other. I&rsquo;m more glad than
I can say that you&rsquo;re happy. I only hope it&rsquo;s going to
last for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps there was a dubious note in his voice, for an
anxious gleam crept into the girl&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sound as if you don&rsquo;t think that it will,&rdquo; she said
quickly.</p>
<p>Micky made a hurried disclaimer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think so, of course I do! You deserve all the
happiness you can get, and whoever the man is, if he
doesn&rsquo;t make you happy&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, with frowning memory of Ashton and
their parting only last night.</p>
<p>He hoped in his heart that they would never meet
again; if they did, he realised that there would be quite
a few nasty things he would feel called upon to say to
him.</p>
<p>The waitress brought the bill at that moment and put
an end to further conversation, for which he was thankful.
He realised that he was getting rather out of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
depth. He breathed more freely when they were safely
out in the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is the new boarding-house?&rdquo; he asked
presently. He wanted to change the subject; every moment
he was afraid that he would say something to give
himself away. He supposed he had behaved like an impetuous
fool. He ought never to have posted that letter&ndash;&ndash;ought
never to have opened Ashton&rsquo;s; and yet&ndash;&ndash;if he
had not done so.... He looked down at the girl
beside him, and wondered grimly how she would have
felt if he had allowed that callous farewell to reach her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite close to where we are now,&rdquo; she told him.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather more expensive than the last one, but it&rsquo;s
well worth the extra money, and&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she glanced up at
him smilingly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m better off to-day than I was yesterday,&rdquo;
she explained. &ldquo;And when I go back to work
again&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going back, then?&rdquo; he asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am. I must do something, and they will
take me back at Eldred&rsquo;s, I know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eldred&rsquo;s!&rdquo; Micky frowned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the petticoat
shop, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; how did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the place lots of times. A girl I know buys
all her&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He stopped. &ldquo;Do you want to go back
there?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not particularly, but it&rsquo;s easier than looking for a
fresh place, and I know they will take me. I&rsquo;m in the
workroom, and it&rsquo;s not really such a hard life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky did some rapid thinking; it was surprising how
easily his brain had taken to hard work during the last
twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get a job as a companion to a nice old
lady or somebody?&rdquo; he suggested vaguely.</p>
<p>She laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t sound a bit attractive,&rdquo; she said frankly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
&ldquo;I think you need an awful lot of patience. It&rsquo;s very
kind of you to be interested, but I think I shall go back
to Eldred&rsquo;s, for a time, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky did not like the idea at all, but he let the subject
drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going back to the Brixton Road?&rdquo; he asked
after a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no; I paid them before I left this afternoon, so
I shall go straight to the new place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to walk there with you, if I may,&rdquo; said
Micky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when shall I see you again?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not going to vanish for days, are you? I&rsquo;ve got no end
of time to kill, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she reminded him. &ldquo;At least, I shan&rsquo;t
have when I start work. But I should like to see you
again,&rdquo; she added kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Micky with faint sarcasm.</p>
<p>He felt vaguely disappointed with the whole afternoon.
She was holding him so decidedly at arm&rsquo;s length.
He supposed it was that infernal fellow Ashton that
stood between them. There was a sort of irony, too, in
the fact that he himself had by his own action established
him more firmly than ever in this girl&rsquo;s affections.</p>
<p>And the fellow was not worth a thought! That was
the rotten part of it. As he looked at her he felt strongly
tempted to blurt out the truth; to tell her that it was he
who wrote that letter&ndash;&ndash;to undeceive her once and for all.</p>
<p>But the thing was manifestly impossible. She would
probably think it an abominable thing to have opened
Ashton&rsquo;s letter; she would probably be furious if he let
her know that the money she had received had come from
him. Whichever way he turned he seemed to be in a
corner.</p>
<p>They had reached the new boarding-house now, and
Micky was relieved to see that it was a decided improvement
on the one in the Brixton Road.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>The windows were not boxed up, and the steps and
the bell were clean. It was on the sunny side of the
road, too, and had an air of cheerfulness about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much better than the other one, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Esther
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Streets better,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind
living here myself....&rdquo; He waited, but she made
no comment, and he felt rather snubbed.</p>
<p>There was a little silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like the place where you are living now?&rdquo;
she asked after a moment. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they make you comfortable
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s comfortable enough,&rdquo; said Micky. He wondered
if he looked as guilty as he felt. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t believe
in sticking on anywhere too long. A change is
good for every one. I shall be shifting out some day
soon, I expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall see you again soon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And if there is
anything I can do for you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, but there isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; She spoke quite kindly,
but Micky had the uncomfortable sort of feeling that
her thoughts were elsewhere. He waited a moment,
then held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, and thank you for my tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded and smiled and turned away from him.</p>
<p>There was nothing else for Micky to do but to go;
he raised his hat and walked off disconsolately.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p>When Esther went upstairs to her room in No.
11 Elphinstone Road, she found the door standing
open, and she could hear some one talking
inside.</p>
<p>She stood still for a moment in amazement; she
thought perhaps she had made a mistake and come to the
wrong room, but a glance reassured her; the number of
her room was 23, and this one was 23; she pushed the
door wider and went in.</p>
<p>Her boxes were there, standing one upon the other, so
as to make more space in the small room, and on the
rather shabby rug by the fireplace a woman was kneeling
with her back to the door.</p>
<p>She did not hear Esther enter, and for a moment the
girl stood staring at her in blank amazement. She could
not see her face, but she could see that the woman was
small and slightly built, with a wealth of jet black hair
coiled in becoming carelessness with a couple of yellow
pins to fasten it.</p>
<p>She wore a yellow blouse, which Esther would have
thought hideous on any one else, but somehow against
that dark coil of hair it looked decidedly picturesque.</p>
<p>Esther moved a little, deliberately knocking against a
chair to attract attention, and the girl on the hearthrug
looked round with a startled exclamation; then scrambled
to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard there was a cat,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Lydia told
me that he was shut up here alone, so I just had to come
in and see him. I hope you don&rsquo;t mind. I brought him
some milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Esther was too taken aback to answer.
She looked from the little woman in the yellow blouse to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
Charlie, sprawled on the rug and purring lustily, and then
back again to the little woman.</p>
<p>She was very attractive looking, that was Esther&rsquo;s
first thought, and her next that she had never seen any
one with such a beautiful complexion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Miss Shepstone, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; her visitor queried
in the friendliest of tones. &ldquo;You see, I know quite a
lot about you already. Lydia told me&ndash;&ndash;Lydia&rsquo;s the housemaid&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ll
like her; she&rsquo;s a really nice girl. My name
is June Mason&ndash;&ndash;I live here, too, and I hope we will
be great friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something so breezily disarming about her
that Esther held out her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind. I hardly know what to say....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything,&rdquo; Miss Mason answered airily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to like you; I knew I should somehow when
I first heard your name. I believe in that sort of thing&ndash;&ndash;I
don&rsquo;t know if you do, but as soon as Lydia told me
who it was that had taken this room I knew I should
like you. I think your name is sweet&ndash;&ndash;Esther! So
quaint and old-world. Have you had your tea?&ndash;&ndash;yes, oh,
what a shame! I&rsquo;ve got some ready for you in my
room. Oh, I hope you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s awful cheek,&rdquo; she
broke out with a sort of embarrassment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a
sitting-room here as well as a bedroom, and I always
make my own tea, it&rsquo;s better than you can get downstairs.
I&rsquo;ve got a fire there too, and if you&rsquo;re ever cold
I hope you&rsquo;ll come and sit with me. I&rsquo;m out a good
deal but you can always use my room when I&rsquo;m not
there, if you care to. Take off your hat and come and
see it now, or are you too tired? I don&rsquo;t want to worry
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bit tired,&rdquo; Esther said, laughing; she felt a
little bewildered by this sudden offer of friendship, but
June Mason interested her, and after a moment she took
off her hat obediently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bring the cat too,&rdquo; Miss Mason said; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
swooped down with a quick movement and caught the
cat up in her arms. &ldquo;I love cats,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; said Esther shyly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very thin, but they
weren&rsquo;t kind to him where he belonged before....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a shame! I simply loathe people who are not
kind to animals. Never mind, he&rsquo;ll soon get all right.
Now come along&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll help you unpack your boxes presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led the way downstairs, and Esther followed.</p>
<p>She had been feeling a little scared of this new boarding-house.
She felt grateful for this girl&rsquo;s unaffected overture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s the best room in the house,&rdquo; Miss Mason informed
her. She pushed open the door of a room immediately
below Esther&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Sit down and make yourself
at home. I&rsquo;ll get the tea in half a minute. I know you&rsquo;ll
have another cup. I shall, anyway. Do you smoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I do. I hope you&rsquo;re not shocked. I find it&rsquo;s so
soothing when you&rsquo;ve got nerves; and I&rsquo;m a frightfully
nervy person. I am hardly ever still; I&rsquo;m always on
the go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther could well believe it. She looked on with a
slightly dazed feeling while June Mason lit a cigarette
and bustled about the room.</p>
<p>It was a very comfortable room, with plenty of easy-chairs
and lots of cushions all in the same pale shade of
mauve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think there would be any rooms as comfortable
as this in the house,&rdquo; Esther said. &ldquo;I suppose you
pay a great deal for it, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. Most of the furniture is
mine and all the cushions. Do you like my cushions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put down the teapot, which she had been about to
fill, and caught up one of the cushions, plumping its softness
together with her white hands.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mauve is my lucky colour,&rdquo; she rattled on. &ldquo;Everything
I do in mauve turns out well. But perhaps you
don&rsquo;t believe in a superstition like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther was rather bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. I never thought about it,&rdquo; she said
hesitatingly. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a very pretty colour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Mason dropped the cushion to the floor, and
stooping picked Charlie up and deposited him on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he look sweet?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;And a black
cat is lucky too, you know, so that&rsquo;s a comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went back to the teapot, made the tea, and poured
out a cup for Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that chair comfy?&ndash;&ndash;yes, lean back! What are you
looking at? Oh, my photographs! Yes. I have got a
lot, haven&rsquo;t I? Lydia dusts them for me! Lydia&rsquo;s a
treasure! You&rsquo;ll love her. When I get married she&rsquo;s
going to leave here and come with me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther looked interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to be married?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Miss Mason laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I? No, I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m too fond of my independence.
Not that I don&rsquo;t like men. I do like them, and
I&rsquo;ve got some awfully good pals amongst them, too.
Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned with one of her rapid movements, caught
up a photograph from the shelf and handed it to Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! that&rsquo;s one of the nicest men I ever met in my
life,&rdquo; she said enthusiastically. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he&rsquo;s got
a ripping face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther took the portrait laughingly&ndash;&ndash;she thought June
Mason one of the most amusing people she had ever
met&ndash;&ndash;then she caught her breath on a little smothered
exclamation as she found herself looking straight into
the pictured eyes of Micky Mellowes.</p>
<p>June Mason was too occupied with a fresh cigarette
to notice the blank look that filled Esther&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>She sat there in the big chair, staring at Micky&rsquo;s portrait
with a sense of foreboding. Surely it was something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
bigger than just chance that had introduced him
into her life for the second time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of the best,&rdquo; June Mason went on. She
dragged forward another chair and plumped down into
it comfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you admire him?&rdquo; She opened her eyes wide,
looking across at Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, oh yes! I think he&rsquo;s quite nice,&rdquo; Esther said
stiltedly. &ldquo;But not a bit good-looking, do you think?&rdquo;
she asked, with a sort of hesitation.</p>
<p>Miss Mason took the portrait from her and held it
at arm&rsquo;s length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; she said critically. &ldquo;Perhaps he isn&rsquo;t, but I
like him so much, you see, that I&rsquo;m not a fair judge.
He&rsquo;s been a good friend to me, at all events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She got up, replaced the frame on the shelf, and
plumped back once more amongst her mauve cushions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My people wanted me to marry him at one time,&rdquo;
she went on airily. &ldquo;I might have done so only I liked
him too well. He didn&rsquo;t care for me, except as a friend,
and it seemed a shame to spoil it, so I put my foot down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that you refused him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther was interested; she was remembering how
Micky had told her that he had never really cared for
any woman in all his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never asked me, my dear,&rdquo; Miss Mason answered
candidly. &ldquo;I let him see that it wouldn&rsquo;t be any good if
he did, and I know he was frightfully relieved. We were
never so nearly in love with one another as we were
when we both knew that we didn&rsquo;t mean to get married.&rdquo;
She chuckled reminiscently. &ldquo;It finished me with my
people, though,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;so I cleared out and came
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;Micky?&rdquo; Esther asked. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I mean Mr. Mellowes....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Mason looked faintly surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know his name?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Did I
tell you? I suppose I did. Oh, he&rsquo;s all right; he&rsquo;s the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
kind of man who always will be all right. He&rsquo;s got another
girl on the tapis now. I don&rsquo;t know if it will come
to anything, though. Anyway, she&rsquo;s not good enough for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem very fond of him,&rdquo; Esther said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am. He&rsquo;s a dear! I should love to see him happily
married to a girl with a heart of gold like his own.
I think I know him better than most people, and his
little corner of the world would be amazed if they knew
the amount of good Micky manages to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had flushed up with her own enthusiasm. Her
curious eyes (Esther could not decide if they were grey,
blue, or green, or a mixture of all three) were very
bright and expressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard lots of rotten things said about him,&rdquo; she
went on, &ldquo;and I know that none of them are really deserved&ndash;&ndash;at
least most of them are not. He isn&rsquo;t a saint&ndash;&ndash;but
what man is, I should like to know? But Micky&rsquo;s the
sort who would give his life for a friend or any one little
and weak. Do you know&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she flung away the half-smoked
cigarette and leaned forward with her elbows
on her knees&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;last winter, down in the country, I saw
Micky go into a dirty pond in evening dress to rescue
a drowning cat. What do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;cat!&rdquo; said Esther faintly. She looked at Charlie,
and remembered how Micky had paid for milk for
him the night of their strange meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A miserable drowning cat!&rdquo; Miss Mason went on
with tragic emphasis. &ldquo;He heard it mewing from the
road, and he went in after it without stopping to think.
Now, I call a man a hero who will do a thing like that
when he is on his way to a dance he is very keen about,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Esther. Her heart warmed towards Mellowes.
Kind as he had been to her, she had not been
quite sure of him; it made her feel happier to hear him
so warmly championed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sick to death of my chatter,&rdquo; June Mason
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
broke out with sudden change of voice. She helped herself
to a third cigarette. &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind smoke,&rdquo;
she apologised. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always at it; I think I smoke dozens
a day&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or throw them away half smoked,&rdquo; Esther thought
amusedly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind at all,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me a thing about yourself,&rdquo; Miss
Mason reminded her reproachfully. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not fair
that I should do all the talking. I know your name,
and that&rsquo;s about all. Have you got any people? Where
do you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther flushed a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to tell you. I haven&rsquo;t any people. I
was born in India, and my mother died there. I don&rsquo;t
know anything about my father. I was sent home to an
aunt, and she looked after me till about three years ago,
when she died. I came to London then, and they took
me on at Eldred&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;do you know Eldred&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I not?&rdquo; said Miss Mason fervently. &ldquo;Scrumptious
things they make; but what prices! I can&rsquo;t afford
them very often, but I go in there a good deal. I know
the manager, and he&rsquo;s going to do some business for me&ndash;&ndash;at
least I hope he is. If I can get my stuff into his
place it will be a splendid thing. All London shops
there, you know; all London with any money, that is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther looked mystified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your stuff!&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>June Mason laughed merrily. She had a very infectious
laugh and a trick of covering her face with her
hands while she was laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot that you didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I seem
to know you so well, I can&rsquo;t remember that we never
saw one another before to-day. My dear, I make face
cream. Wait a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang up and disappeared behind a mauve curtain
into an adjoining room. Esther heard her moving
about, opening and shutting boxes and singing a snatch
of song all the time. Presently she came back with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
tray crowded with little pots and phials of all sizes and
descriptions. She plumped down on her knees beside
Esther&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo; she said lightly, though there was
an odd dash of pride in her voice. &ldquo;Face cream, night
and day cream, eyelash tonic, and all the rest of it! Of
course, I&rsquo;m only just starting&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m not like those people
who advertise in all the papers and charge about a guinea
for a shilling jar; but my stuff is as good as theirs any
day, and better, because it&rsquo;s pure. Look!&rdquo; She took a
lid off a little white pot with a mauve label and held it
to Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a glorious perfume?&rdquo; she demanded. She
sniffed it herself with relish. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s all my invention,
and I&rsquo;m as proud of it as a cat would be of nine
tails. When I&rsquo;ve got things a little more ship-shape,
Micky&rsquo;s going to put it on the market for me. It wants
a man behind all these sort of things you know. I can
do all the donkey work, but I&rsquo;ve got no head for business.
I never know the difference between a loss and a profit.
It was partly over this that I quarrelled with my people&ndash;&ndash;they
said it was low-down to make face cream and sell
it&ndash;&ndash;they&rsquo;re awful snobs! So I just cleared off and
changed my surname and came here. I&rsquo;m quite happy,
and if I haven&rsquo;t got as much money as I had, I don&rsquo;t
mind&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve got my liberty, and that&rsquo;s worth every thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re just wonderful,&rdquo; Esther said. She
picked up a lid from one of the little pots and looked at
the mauve and white label.</p>
<p>&ldquo;June Mason&rsquo;s natural beautifier....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at the glowing face opposite to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you use it for your own skin?&rdquo; she asked shyly.</p>
<p>Miss Mason chuckled; she pushed the tray to one side
along the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that I&rsquo;ve never used cream
to my skin at all,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But people think I do, and
so there you are! Have some more tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She refilled Esther&rsquo;s cup and lit another cigarette. &ldquo;So
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
that&rsquo;s what I am,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And now go on, and tell
me about yourself. You said you were at Eldred&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was there for two years. I rather liked it!
I love pretty things, and I was in the workroom. They
paid me quite well, too, though it was hard work, and
then&ndash;&ndash;well, then I left&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; her voice changed subtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The query was only interested, and not at all impertinent.</p>
<p>Esther flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;I thought I was going to be married.
He&ndash;&ndash;well, he asked me to leave to marry him, and so
I did....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Esther was looking away into the fire. &ldquo;No,
I&rsquo;m not married,&rdquo; she said in a stifled voice. &ldquo;He&ndash;&ndash;my
fianc&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;has had to go away on business&ndash;&ndash;abroad, and I
don&rsquo;t know when I shall see him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice sounded sad and dispirited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor little thing!&rdquo; said June Mason. She leaned
over and laid her hand on Esther&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Never mind! The
time will soon pass, and then he&rsquo;ll come back and you&rsquo;ll
live happily ever after&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I keep on telling myself it&rsquo;s foolish to worry.
I felt quite happy this morning. I had a letter from
him, and somehow when I read it things didn&rsquo;t seem half
so bad; but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll have another to-morrow, I expect.&rdquo; Miss
Mason insisted. &ldquo;And another the next day, and one
every day while he&rsquo;s away. There! That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; she
added cheerily as Esther laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to see you look so sad. I&rsquo;m going to
cheer you up. I shan&rsquo;t allow you to be miserable. And
anyway,&rdquo; she added, with a sudden softening, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got
some one who loves you, and that&rsquo;s worth everything else
in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Esther. Her eyes shone and she thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
of the letter which was even then lying against her heart.
Somehow she had never realised how much he really
cared for her till to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are you going to do till he comes home?&rdquo;
Miss Mason asked interestedly. &ldquo;If you had something
to do you&rsquo;d find the time pass ever so much more
quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a question of having to do something rather than
how to pass the time,&rdquo; Esther said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any money
except what I can make. My aunt left me a little when
she died, but it was only a very little, and I spent most
of it at first while I was looking for work. So I&rsquo;m going
back to Eldred&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;if they will have me, and I think they
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Mason said &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re too good for a petticoat shop,&rdquo; she
said bluntly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wasted there! Nobody sees you, and
you&rsquo;re so pretty&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what nonsense!&rdquo; Esther exclaimed. She laughed
in sheer amusement. To her it seemed absurd for this
girl to call her pretty; she considered June Mason such
a personality&ndash;&ndash;so attractive!</p>
<p>She really did make a picturesque figure as she sat
there with her mauve cushions all around her. Her
yellow blouse and dark hair and wonderful rose-leaf
skin reminded one of some brilliant portrait painted by
a master-hand.</p>
<p>Esther would have been surprised could she have
known the thought in June&rsquo;s mind at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just sweet! I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ve seen a face
I admire more. Micky would adore her! She&rsquo;s just the
sort of woman he always raves about. I must ask him to
tea to meet her one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are heaps of other berths going besides Eldred&rsquo;s,
you know,&rdquo; she said earnestly. &ldquo;However, you
must do as you like, of course.&rdquo; She threw away another
unfinished cigarette. &ldquo;Do you think we are going to be
friends?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure we are,&rdquo; Esther said. She really did think
so; she had never met any one in the least like June
Mason before. She began to feel glad that she had come
to this house. It was much more expensive than the
Brixton Road, certainly, but it was well worth it, even if
only because she had met this quaint little woman.</p>
<p>It was nearly seven o&rsquo;clock before she thought of going
back to her own room, and then it was only the chiming
of a clock on the shelf that roused her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly seven!&rdquo; She started up in dismay. &ldquo;I had
no idea it was so late. I am sorry for having stayed so
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be sorry for,&rdquo; June declared. &ldquo;You
may go shares with this room if you like. I&rsquo;m out so
much, it isn&rsquo;t used half the time. Think it over, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther flushed nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully kind of you; I should love to, but I
couldn&rsquo;t afford it. I&rsquo;m really paying more money now
than I ought to. I want to save, too&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Mason laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the wedding! Lucky girl! I hope you&rsquo;ll ask me
to come and see you married&ndash;&ndash;and I hope he&rsquo;s very nice,&rdquo;
she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said Esther eagerly. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s very handsome,&rdquo;
she added shyly.</p>
<p>But Miss Mason was not impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a fig if a man is handsome or not,&rdquo; she
said bluntly. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s just manly and straightforward and
kind, that&rsquo;s all I expect him to be. Now look here&ndash;&ndash;we
have dinner at half-past seven in this establishment. It&rsquo;s
only supper really, but we all put on our best blouses&ndash;&ndash;if
we&rsquo;ve got any&ndash;&ndash;and call it dinner. I&rsquo;ll call for you on the
way down and we&rsquo;ll go in together. I&rsquo;ll tell Mrs. Elders
you are going to share my table, if you like; it&rsquo;s deadly
dull sitting alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to sit with you very much,&rdquo; Esther said
eagerly. &ldquo;But I really haven&rsquo;t got a &lsquo;best&rsquo; blouse.&rdquo; She
glanced down at the plain white silk shirt she wore; it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
had been washed many times, and had lost its first freshness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down as you are, then,&rdquo; Miss Mason urged,
&ldquo;and I will too! I hate changing. This yellow rag is good
enough for the old tabbies we get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther went half-way down the stairs and came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve forgotten Charlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie can stay where he is till bedtime,&rdquo; June declared.
&ldquo;You can come up and fetch him then. Hurry,
or you&rsquo;ll be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther went down to her room, feeling more light-hearted
than she had done for a long time.</p>
<p>As she unpacked her boxes and tidied her hair she
could hear June Mason moving about upstairs, singing
cheerily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to like her&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m going to like her awfully,&rdquo;
she told herself. She hurried to be ready in time, but the
rather unmelodious dinner-bell had clanged through the
house twice before June came to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve unpacked, then?&rdquo; she said. She looked round
the small room approvingly. &ldquo;I can see you&rsquo;re one of the
tidy ones,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not; I wish I were. However,
we can&rsquo;t all be the same. Are you ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took Esther&rsquo;s arm and they went downstairs together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one knows you&rsquo;re coming,&rdquo; June said as they
neared the dining-room. &ldquo;Every one always knows everything
that goes on here. Don&rsquo;t take any notice if they
stare a lot; they must stare at something, poor darlings.
I&rsquo;ll tell you who they all are and all about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dining-room was a long, narrow sort of room that
looked as if it once had been two rooms recently thrown
into one; the floor was covered with slippery green linoleum,
and there was a long table running almost the
length of the room, with a few smaller ones on either
side.</p>
<p>A grey-haired woman with pebble glasses stood at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
head of the long table; Esther recognised her as the
proprietress, Mrs. Elders.</p>
<p>She said good-evening to Esther and stared frigidly at
June, as if she did not like to see the two girls together.
She did not approve of the little face cream lady, though
she was careful never to say so, as June was one of her
best paying propositions.</p>
<p>Esther was glad when they reached their own table;
glad, too, that she was more or less out of the way of
curious glances.</p>
<p>The dinner was plain, but infinitely superior to the fare
she had had to put up with in the Brixton Road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have all your meals here?&rdquo; she asked June
presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;only breakfast and supper&ndash;&ndash;and not always supper.
I go out with friends sometimes. Every one hasn&rsquo;t
given me up just because my family have. But the food
is quite good here. They&rsquo;re rather too fond of rice and
stewed apples; but it might be worse. Turn round presently
and look at the man behind you with the grey hair.
Isn&rsquo;t he handsome? We call him the colonel, though I
don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s a colonel at all. He&rsquo;s a dear, but he
always complains about everything. I know he gives notice
regularly on Saturday morning and takes it back
again on Saturday night. Mrs. Elders would think he
wasn&rsquo;t well if he missed giving her notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, and turning in her chair spoke to a young
man who was sitting alone at one of the smaller tables
behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your cough better?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give
you some special stuff to-night for it. No, it isn&rsquo;t at all
nasty.&rdquo; She turned back to Esther. &ldquo;May I introduce
Mr. Harley&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s the most interesting person in the
whole house. He writes stories and things, Mr. Harley,
this is Miss Shepstone&ndash;&ndash;a great friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley bowed. He was pale, delicate-looking young
man with fine dark eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You never told me that you knew Miss Shepstone,&rdquo; he
said to June.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know her till this afternoon,&rdquo; she answered
promptly; &ldquo;but I make friends quickly, as you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll like Harley,&rdquo; she told Esther presently in an
undertone. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s very clever, but so delicate, poor boy!
He ought to live in the country instead of in London.
He&rsquo;s the sort of person I should love to help if I were
rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be wonderful to be rich,&rdquo; Esther said. There
was a little flush in her cheeks; she was really enjoying
herself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the dream of my life to have enough money
to be able to do anything I like,&rdquo; she added earnestly.
&ldquo;Just for a month! If I could be really rich just for one
month I wouldn&rsquo;t mind going back to being poor again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Mason said &ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; briskly. &ldquo;Money can&rsquo;t
buy happiness, my dear, and don&rsquo;t you forget it. My
people think it can, and lots of other people think the
same. It only shows what fools they are. It was the
money my people couldn&rsquo;t get over when I declined to
marry Micky Mellowes....&rdquo; She made a little wry
face. &ldquo;I remember my mother coming into my room one
night in her dressing-gown&ndash;&ndash;poor soul!&ndash;&ndash;when she heard
I&rsquo;d told Micky there was nothing doing, and saying tragically:
&lsquo;June, you must be mad&ndash;&ndash;stark, staring mad! Why,
the man&rsquo;s as rich as Cr&oelig;sus!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich!&rdquo; Esther was conscious of an odd little sinking
at her heart. &ldquo;Is Mr. Mellowes rich, then?&rdquo; she asked
constrainedly.</p>
<p>Miss Mason was helping herself to a pat of butter.
She held it poised for a moment on the end of her knife
while she answered&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich? I should think he is! He&rsquo;s one of the richest
men in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the richest men in London!&ndash;&ndash;but he&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Esther
had been going to add &ldquo;But he told me that he was
poor;&rdquo; she only just checked the words in time.</p>
<p>June nodded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the despair of all the match-making mammas,&rdquo;
she said lightly. &ldquo;Over thirty, he is, and still a bachelor!
I&rsquo;m not sure if he isn&rsquo;t on the verge of being caught
now, but you never can tell! With a little luck he may
escape&ndash;&ndash;she isn&rsquo;t good enough for him, anyway. Have
you finished? I&rsquo;m dying for a cigarette, and we aren&rsquo;t
allowed to smoke here. Come up to my room and I&rsquo;ll
make you some coffee; the stuff they give us here isn&rsquo;t
fit to drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pushed back her chair and rose, and Esther followed.</p>
<p>She kept her eyes down as she walked the length of
the room; the colour rose in her cheeks as she realised
how every one was staring at her. The colonel, whom
June had declared was not a colonel at all, rose and held
the door open for them to pass out.</p>
<p>June chuckled as they went upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made an impression, my dear! It isn&rsquo;t often
he does that for any one.&rdquo; She slipped an arm through
Esther&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Why are you frowning so? Have I said anything
to annoy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I was only thinking.... Do
you&ndash;&ndash;do your friends ever come here to see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was thinking of Micky Mellowes, and wondering
if he ever came to the boarding-house, and if so, why he
had not told her that he knew somebody living here.
After all, if he had deceived her in one instance he would
do so in many others&ndash;&ndash;she felt a curious sense of hurt
pride; why had he gone out of his way to tell her he was
a poor man, when all the time&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; June said frankly, &ldquo;none of my
friends know where I am living. Call it false pride if
you like, but there you are. I have all my letters, except
business ones, sent to my club&ndash;&ndash;I belong to an unpretentious
club&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll take you there some day&ndash;&ndash;and not even
Micky knows that I live here. You see, when I flew
in the face of providence, otherwise my noble family,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
they stopped my allowance, so as I&rsquo;m entirely self-supporting,
I had to be careful and live inexpensively, so I
came here. And I&rsquo;m very comfortable. If I want to
meet any of my friends we meet out somewhere. I think
it&rsquo;s better; it leaves me quite free....&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were back in her room again now, and Charlie
had looked up with one eye from his mauve cushion, and
purred, by way of a greeting.</p>
<p>June lit a cigarette and rushed about in pursuit of
the coffee-pot. All her movements were quick. She
seemed to breathe life and energy.</p>
<p>Esther walked over to the fireplace, and found herself
looking at Micky&rsquo;s photograph.</p>
<p>After all, he was just like all the other men she had
ever known; apparently none of them could be simple
and sincere; she supposed it had been his way of condescending
to her, to pretend that he was poor and in
similar circumstances to herself; perhaps he had guessed
that she would never have allowed him to pay for her
supper or tea, or have talked to her as he had done, if she
had known him to be a rich man.</p>
<p>She need never see him again, that was one thing; her
heart hardened as she met the frankness of his pictured
eyes; he was not as honest as he looked.</p>
<p>She had mistaken condescension for kindness. She
bit her lip with mortification as she recalled the confidence
she had made to him only that afternoon. He was probably
laughing at it now, and no doubt would repeat all
she had said to his friends as a good joke.</p>
<p>She went to her own room as soon as she had had the
coffee. She made the excuse that she was tired, but
when she went upstairs she sat down on the side of the
bed and made no effort to undress. A sort of shadow
seemed to have fallen on her spirits. She felt mortified
that Micky should so deliberately have lied to her; her
cheeks burned as she thought of the despair she had
been in last night when she met him. She hoped she
would never see him again.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>She looked round the little room with angry eyes. If
only Fate had set her feet in sunnier paths. She looked
at the plain furniture and cheap carpet; the wallpaper
was hideous; there was a frightful oleograph of two
Early Victorian women with crinolines and ringlet curls
hanging over the mantlepiece. They both looked smug
and self-satisfied. There was an enlarged photograph of
a bald-headed man wearing a Masonic apron on another
wall. He was fat and had his right hand plastered carefully
along a chair-back to bring into prominence a large
signet ring. Esther looked at him and shivered. She felt
utterly alone and cut off from the world. She longed for
Raymond Ashton with all her soul. She hated Micky
Mellowes because his kindly condescension had made her
feel her position more acutely now she knew him to be
what he was.</p>
<p>In spite of the new friend she had made in June Mason
she felt lonely and unwanted; she began to cry like a
child, as she sat there on the side of the iron bedstead;
the tears ran down her cheeks and she made no effort to
wipe them away.</p>
<p>She wanted to be happy so badly, and it seemed as if
she never was to be happy. The elation that had come to
her when she read Micky&rsquo;s letter that morning had faded
miserably; after all, what was a letter when it was a real,
living personality she wanted, and not mere words?</p>
<p>Downstairs she could hear June Mason moving about
and singing; she at least was happy with her little mauve
pots and her cheery optimism.</p>
<p>Esther cried all the time she undressed; she crept into
bed sobbing miserably, like a child who sleeps at a boarding-school
for the first time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p>Micky passed three days before he made any attempt
to see Esther Shepstone again; days that
seemed like a month at least, and during which
he lost his appetite and forgot to smoke.</p>
<p>That she did not particularly care if she saw him again
or not, he was miserably sure. She had no thoughts for
any one but Ashton. He felt as if he could not settle
to anything. On the third morning Marie Deland rang
him up. He had told her many times that her voice on
the telephone cheered him, but to-day it made him frown.</p>
<p>He tried to answer her cheery &ldquo;That you, Micky?&rdquo; as
cheerily, but he knew it was a failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she asked quickly. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you
well? Or are you cross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a hint of laughter in her voice. She had
never known Micky cross; he was always the cheeriest of
mortals.</p>
<p>Micky grabbed at the excuse she offered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a brute of a headache,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old boy!&rdquo; The pretty, sympathetic voice irritated
him. &ldquo;Come out for a walk; it will do you good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks&ndash;&ndash;thanks awfully, but I don&rsquo;t think it would.
I&rsquo;m a perfect bear&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;d hate me. Some other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little pause. Micky could have kicked
himself as he remembered on what terms they had parted.
It was not her fault that a miracle had happened since
then to metamorphose the whole world. He supposed uncomfortably
that she was just the same as she had been
when he last saw her. He knew she must be wondering
why he had stayed away so long. He tried to soften his
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look in to-night, if I may. Sorry to be such a
bear.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></div>
<p>She answered rather dispiritedly that it was all right,
that she was sorry he felt ill. It was a relief when she
rang off. He took his hat and went off to call on Esther.</p>
<p>He felt that he could settle to nothing till he had seen
her again; there was a curious jealousy in his heart about
Ashton; he would have given anything he possessed to be
able to disillusion her, but knew it was impossible without
hopelessly compromising himself.</p>
<p>It was a bitter disappointment to find that she was out
when he reached the boarding-house; his face fell absurdly
when he turned and walked away.</p>
<p>He wondered if she really was out, or only out to
him.</p>
<p>After a moment he laughed at himself. A few days
ago he had not known there was such a person as Esther
Shepstone in the world, and yet now here he was, consumed
with jealousy because she was not in when he
called.</p>
<p>He took a taxicab back to the West End; he walked
about for half an hour staring aimlessly into shop windows,
then went back to his rooms. He could not understand
his extraordinary restlessness; he had only once
before felt anything like it in all his life, and that had
been the first time he ever backed a horse, and was waiting
a wire from the course to say if the brute had won.</p>
<p>He recalled the fever of impatience that had consumed
him then, and laughed; after all, it had been nothing
compared with this.</p>
<p>Driver came into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir, Miss Mason has been on the &rsquo;phone.
She said would I ask you to meet her for tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky did not look enthusiastic; he liked June awfully,
but to-day every one and everything seemed a bore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea! Where?&rdquo; he asked vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Mason said that you would know, sir; the same
place as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky looked at the clock and sighed. After all, June
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
was always amusing; he went off almost cheerfully to the
unpretentious club of which she had spoken to Esther.
He had to wait in the lobby while a boy in buttons fetched
June to him. She came downstairs looking very much
at home, and smoking the inevitable cigarette. It was
one of June Mason&rsquo;s charms that she always managed to
look at home wherever she was.</p>
<p>She had taken off her coat, but she wore a green hat
with a gold ornament that suited her to perfection, set
on her dark head at rakish angle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I began to think you were not coming,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She gave him her left hand, and Micky squeezed it in
friendly fashion. They went upstairs together to a small
tea-room, which was just now deserted save for two
waitresses who were giggling together over a newspaper.</p>
<p>June walked over to a table in the window, and Micky
followed.</p>
<p>He had been here with her scores of times before, and
the two waitresses smiled at one another knowingly; they
were quite sure that this was romance.</p>
<p>Micky was sitting with an elbow on the table, absently
smoothing the back of his head; he was wishing it was
Esther sitting opposite to him; he looked up with a little
start when June spoke to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Micky? I&rsquo;ve never seen you looking so
depressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He roused himself with an effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, nothing! It&rsquo;s the beastly weather, I
expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him quizzically with her queer eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought the weather would depress
you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;However, if you say it does&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook himself together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not depressed any longer,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Well,
and how are you? And how is the swindle?&rdquo; It was
Micky&rsquo;s pet joke to call June&rsquo;s invention the &ldquo;swindle,&rdquo;
though in his heart he was almost as proud of it as she
was.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very well, thank you; but that isn&rsquo;t what I want
to talk to you about to-day. Micky, would you like to
come to tea with me one afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea! Haven&rsquo;t I come to tea with you to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly! I don&rsquo;t mean here; I mean where I live. It&rsquo;s
a boarding-house. I dare say you&rsquo;ll hate it, but it&rsquo;s really
quite a nice place, and beggars can&rsquo;t be choosers, anyway.
I&rsquo;ve got a very comfortable sitting-room and most
of my own furniture, and I can give you a good cup of
tea, or anything else, if you prefer it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted,&rdquo; Micky looked puzzled. &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t
this rather a breaking of rules? It&rsquo;s not so very long
ago that you made me swear never to try and find out
where you lived. I thought it was all to be a deadly
secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was, but I&rsquo;ve decided to admit you. I know
you&rsquo;re safe, and, Micky, wouldn&rsquo;t you like to meet the
dearest, prettiest, most attractive little girl....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky moved his chair back in mock alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;June! You&rsquo;re not turning match-maker! If you are,
I give you fair warning that our friendship will have
to end once and for ever. I&rsquo;ll put up with a lot from you,
but not this&ndash;&ndash;not....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an idiot!&rdquo; said June calmly. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t
the slightest fear! And anyway&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she added, with a
half sigh, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s engaged, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be any good. But
I want you to help her.... Oh, I know I&rsquo;m always
bringing you foundlings to help and look after, but you&rsquo;ve
got such a big heart&ndash;&ndash;and such a big banking account,&rdquo;
she added audaciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go on&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he said resignedly. &ldquo;Who is the
foundling this time, and what am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a darling,&rdquo; June said warmly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only
known her for four days&ndash;&ndash;she lives in the same house. I
took a fancy to her from the first moment I saw her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
No, it was before that&ndash;&ndash;it was when I first heard her
name....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky raised his brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a creature of impulse! My dear, you&rsquo;ll burn
your fingers badly some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I do,&rdquo; said Miss Mason sharply, &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t
come crying to you for sympathy; however ... Well,
she&rsquo;s poor! she&rsquo;s one of those horribly poor, frightfully
proud people whom it&rsquo;s impossible to help. I&rsquo;ve tried all
ways! I asked her to go shares with my sitting-room,
and she said she couldn&rsquo;t afford it; she&rsquo;ll hardly let me
give her a cup of tea or coffee for fear I should think
she is sponging on me. She seems most frightfully alone
in the world. She says she engaged to a man, but he&rsquo;s
abroad, and I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s not nice, anyway. He&rsquo;s only
written to her once since I&rsquo;ve known her, at all events,
and this morning when there wasn&rsquo;t a letter, I know she
went back to her room and cried. I knocked at the
door, but she wouldn&rsquo;t let me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, and looked at Micky for sympathy.</p>
<p>He half smiled; he knew how enthusiastic June always
was about everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and what do you want me to do for this damsel
in distress?&rdquo; he asked gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to get her a berth somewhere,&rdquo; he was
told promptly. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s no use saying you can&rsquo;t! My
dear man, you must know scores of people who&rsquo;d take her
in. She thought she was fixed up all right, but now it
appears that the people she was with before haven&rsquo;t got
a vacancy for her, and so that&rsquo;s knocked on the head.
She told me that she&rsquo;s have to just take the first thing that
came along. I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s hardly got a shilling to
her name. I offered to take her into partnership with
me. I said we&rsquo;d go travelling together for my beauty
cream, but she wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it.... She&rsquo;s so
proud!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and here a sound of tears crept into June Mason&rsquo;s
voice. &ldquo;I ask you, Micky, what can be done with
any one like that?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>Micky shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;ll take anything that comes along, she ought to
get a job pretty soon,&rdquo; he said laconically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to
a man I know&ndash;&ndash;can she write a decent hand and all that
sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she can! But I want a good berth, mind
you! I&rsquo;ve never been so fond of anybody as I am of her.
She&rsquo;s awfully worried about this horrid man she&rsquo;s engaged
to. She doesn&rsquo;t say much about him, but this morning
she said that there didn&rsquo;t seem to be anything to live
for, and her eyes looked so sad....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky smiled at her serious face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d make an eloquent appeal in a court of law,&rdquo; he
said. He took a pencil from his pocket and an envelope.
&ldquo;Give me her name and address, and I&rsquo;ll see what I can
do. I don&rsquo;t promise anything, mind you, but I&rsquo;ll do what
I can....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear,&rdquo; said June warmly. &ldquo;I know you were
the one to come to. I&rsquo;m quite sure when you&rsquo;ve seen
Esther you&rsquo;ll ... why, what&rsquo;s the matter, Micky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky had looked up sharply. His face had paled a
little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What name did you say?&rdquo; he asked. He never knew
how he managed to control his voice. His heart seemed
to be thumping in his throat. &ldquo;What name did you say?&rdquo;
he asked again, with an effort. &ldquo;I did not catch it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Esther,&rdquo; said June, &ldquo;Esther Shepstone.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p>Micky&rsquo;s pencil jerked suddenly, sending an aimless
scrawl across the paper; for an instant he
stared at his companion with blank eyes. Fortunately
June Mason was too intent on the relighting of her
cigarette to have any attention to spare for him; she went
on talking as she puffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes....&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;puff&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s her name....&rdquo; Another
puff. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a change from your eternal Violets
and Dorothys?&rdquo;... Puff, puff. &ldquo;Oh, bother!&rdquo; She
threw the cigarette into an empty grate behind her and
prepared to give Micky her undivided attention once
more. &ldquo;Well, what do you think about it? You haven&rsquo;t
written her name down. Esther Shepstone, I said....
Write it down,&rdquo; she commanded.</p>
<p>Micky obeyed at once. He was beginning to recover
himself a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be able to help her all right,&rdquo; he said quickly.
&ldquo;Only, of course, you won&rsquo;t let her know I&rsquo;m mixed up in
it at all; she&rsquo;d hate it if she knew, she....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know she would?&rdquo; June demanded with
suspicion.</p>
<p>Micky met her eyes squarely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you said she was proud or something, didn&rsquo;t
you? And anyway I don&rsquo;t want to pose as a blessed philanthropist;
I&rsquo;m not one either, but I&rsquo;ll see what I can do
for&ndash;&ndash;for this new friend of yours. You say she&rsquo;s poor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horribly poor, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; said June with a sigh.
&ldquo;Micky, it&rsquo;s rather pathetic&ndash;&ndash;somebody sent her some
money&ndash;&ndash;not very much, but still, it was money she evidently
didn&rsquo;t expect. I&rsquo;ve got a sort of idea that it was
from this man she&rsquo;s supposed to be engaged to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say &lsquo;supposed&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;she is engaged to him,
isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>June shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says so, and she wears a ring, but I&rsquo;ve a sort of
instinctive feeling that there&rsquo;s something funny behind it.
Anyway, I know she&rsquo;s not happy; but don&rsquo;t interrupt.
About this money&ndash;&ndash;well, it was partly my fault! I persuaded
her to go and buy herself some clothes&ndash;&ndash;she had
such a few things, poor child! And I even went with her
and she bought a frock and a new coat....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Micky eagerly; he was glad she had bought
a new coat; he remembered how thin hers had been on
that memorable night, and how she had shivered in the
cold night air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was as pleased as a child with a new toy,&rdquo; Miss
Mason went on. &ldquo;She brought them all up to my room
to show me when they came home, and we both tried
them on ... and you&rsquo;ve no idea how sweet she
looked,&rdquo; she added with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Of course, I suppose
this is boring you horribly,&rdquo; she said deprecatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Micky honestly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not boring me at all,
I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, she got the clothes, and now the place
where she was before say they can&rsquo;t take her back&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s
Eldred&rsquo;s, the petticoat shop. I don&rsquo;t suppose you know
it, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it very well,&rdquo; said Micky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you?&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;Well, they either won&rsquo;t
or can&rsquo;t take her back, and now she feels that she ought
not to have spent the money on the new frock and coat,
and this morning she told me that she was afraid she
would have to leave Elphinstone Road, as it was more
than she could afford.&rdquo; June&rsquo;s eyes flashed. &ldquo;Micky,
what can one do with people who are poor and proud?
It&rsquo;s a most difficult combination to fight. I blundered in
and offended her by offering to lend her some money,
and, of course, she wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it, and there you
are!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>She sighed, and leaned back in her chair despondently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a cake,&rdquo; said Micky absently; he pushed the
plate across to her. &ldquo;The ones with the white sugar are
nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Mason ignored him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all the interest you take&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she said offendedly.</p>
<p>Micky started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, I&rsquo;m full of interest&ndash;&ndash;chock full to the
brim! But we came here for tea, so we may as well eat
something while I try to think of a plan.&rdquo; He wrinkled
his forehead. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he ejaculated, &ldquo;that chap&ndash;&ndash;what
did you say his name was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What chap? Oh, the fianc&eacute;! I don&rsquo;t know; she
hasn&rsquo;t even let me see his photograph yet; but she says
he writes dreams of letters. I haven&rsquo;t seen them either,
of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may send her some more money. After all, you
say it&rsquo;s only four days since she heard from him. That&rsquo;s
not very long; men are always rotten letter writers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Mason looked wise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four days is a long time when you&rsquo;re in love,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;If you were engaged to Esther Shepstone I&rsquo;ll bet
you&rsquo;d write to her every day. You&rsquo;re just the kind. Oh,
I know what you&rsquo;re going to say&ndash;&ndash;that you&rsquo;re cut out
for a bachelor, and rubbish like that, but you wait and
see, Micky&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s never too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never written a love-letter in my life,&rdquo; Micky declared
indignantly. &ldquo;And, anyway&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>June leaned across the table and looked at him with
accusing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never? On your word of honour, Micky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky laughed and coloured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps&ndash;&ndash;once!&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s beside
the point, isn&rsquo;t it?... I&rsquo;ll think things over and
write to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but soon, Micky, soon! It&rsquo;s not a case where
you can sit down with your feet on the mantelpiece and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
give yourself a week to turn things over in your mind.
I want to know at once, to-morrow&ndash;&ndash;to-night, if possible.
I know what Esther is&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;ll be gone before I can turn
round, and I should hate her to go. I haven&rsquo;t got many
friends, and I do feel that she and I are going to be real
friends&ndash;&ndash;great friends ... I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ve
taken such a fancy to anybody&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how glad I am to hear you say
that,&rdquo; said Micky. His eyes were shining. Then he
realised that he had displayed rather unnecessary warmth
and hastened to amend his words. &ldquo;I always said that
what you wanted was a real woman friend,&rdquo; he added
more quietly.</p>
<p>June was drawing on her gloves; she had very white
hands and beautifully-kept finger-nails, and she was very
proud of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind me,&rdquo; she said briskly. &ldquo;You bustle about
and find a post for Esther, and I&rsquo;ll love you for ever.
Are we ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose and gathered up her various belongings.
Micky declared that she was always laden with small,
oddly-shaped parcels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Samples, my dear man, samples!&rdquo; she said briskly
when Micky asked if he might not be allowed to carry
some. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re much too precious to risk you dropping
any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one stipulation,&rdquo; Micky said as he followed
her downstairs again. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to tell Miss
Shepstone anything about me&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m going to be very strict
on this subject. Will you promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless your heart, yes&ndash;&ndash;and if you come to tea one
day&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll come to tea,&rdquo; Micky said hastily.
&ldquo;I should only feel rotten&ndash;&ndash;self-conscious and all the rest
of it, even if I was quite sure she didn&rsquo;t know anything&ndash;&ndash;not
that there&rsquo;s anything to know yet,&rdquo; he added quickly.
&ldquo;I may not be able to help her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Mason laughed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll help her right enough,&rdquo; she said breezily.
&ldquo;I know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dismissed him when they reached the street. &ldquo;No,
I don&rsquo;t want you to come with me; I&rsquo;ve got some business
to see to and you&rsquo;d only be a nuisance.&rdquo; She gave his
hand a squeeze. &ldquo;Good-bye, and thanks ever so much
Micky. You&rsquo;ll write to me&ndash;&ndash;or wire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as there is anything to report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his hat and turned away, and June dived
across the road, perilously near to a motor-omnibus,
clutching her samples jealously to her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all right now,&rdquo; she told herself, with a sense
of comfort. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s always all right as soon as
Micky gets hold of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A soliloquy which made it seem all the more curious
that she should have hesitated to trust herself to him for
life. Perhaps, as she had told Esther, she cared too much
for him to take the risk for them both. He had told her
candidly that he did not care for her as a man should
care for the woman he marries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he makes a ripping friend! Ripping!&rdquo; she told
herself as she scurried along to interview another beauty
specialist about the &ldquo;swindle,&rdquo; as Micky politely called it.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_VII' id='CHAPTER_VII'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<p>Micky went straight home when he left June.
What he had heard about Esther had disturbed
him very much. He loathed to think that she
was unhappy.</p>
<p>The question was, how best to help her, and quickly.
He was thankful she had made a friend of June. June
was one of the best, the loyalest pal a man could ever
have.</p>
<p>But, as June had said, Esther was too proud to take
help unless it was most tactfully offered. He racked his
brains in vain. It was a sickening thought that, with all
his wealth, he could give her nothing. Even the few
paltry pounds she had unconsciously taken from him
would have been indignantly rejected had she known who
was the donor.</p>
<p>With sudden impulse he sat down and wrote to her.
After all, she had accepted his friendship; there was no
reason on earth why he should not write and ask to be
allowed to see her again. He wrote most carefully lest
she should discover some likeness to the letter he had
written to replace Ashton&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Might he take her out to dinner one night? Any night
would suit him. And did she like theatres? He had a
friend who sometimes gave him a couple of seats for a
show. He would arrange for any night she liked to
mention.</p>
<p>He thought that was a neat stroke of diplomacy&ndash;&ndash;of
course, she would not think he could afford to buy seats,
and anyway it was true that he had a friend who often
gave him boxes and things&ndash;&ndash;he would have to be careful
that Phillips did not send along a box this time though.</p>
<p>He ended up by hoping formally that she and Charlie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
were quite well and comfortably settled into their new
home, and he signed himself: &ldquo;Yours very sincerely,
Micky Mellowes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had finished the letter, he realised that he had
written it on his own heavily embossed writing paper, so
he had to dig Driver up and borrow a cheap sheet of unstamped
grey paper and write it all out again. Then he went out and
posted it himself.</p>
<p>As soon as it had gone he wished he had sent it by
hand; it meant such a deuce of a time to wait for a reply;
he calculated that he could not possibly hear before to-morrow
night.</p>
<p>But in this he was pleasantly disappointed, for his own
letter reached the boarding-house in Elphinstone Road
that night, and Esther&rsquo;s reply was waiting for him with
the kidney and bacon in the morning.</p>
<p>Micky&rsquo;s heart began to thump when he saw the letter
beside his plate; he had never seen Esther&rsquo;s handwriting,
but he knew by instinct that it was hers. He scanned the
first lines eagerly, and his face fell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Dear Mr. Mellowes</span>,&ndash;&ndash;Thank you for your letter. I am sorry,
but I cannot come out with you, either to dinner or to a theatre.&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='ralign'>Yours very truly, <span class='smcap'>Esther Shepstone</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Micky&rsquo;s face was pathetic in its disappointment. He
read the few curt lines through again and again, vainly
trying to find something more behind the unmistakable
refusal, but there it was in all its bald decision.</p>
<p>She did not want to go out with him any more; she
did not care if she saw him again or not.</p>
<p>Micky left his breakfast, he no longer had any appetite.
He had never had such a snub in all his life&ndash;&ndash;out
of his disappointment anger was rising steadily; she had
no right to snub him like that without a reason.</p>
<p>Driver, coming into the room at that moment, saw the
untouched breakfast and halted midway between door
and table to stare at his master.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>Micky stood with his hands deep thrust into his pockets,
glowering into the fire. Driver advanced a step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, sir&ndash;&ndash;but wasn&rsquo;t you well?&rdquo; he asked stoically.</p>
<p>Micky began to swear, then his mood changed and he
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m all right&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;Driver, would
you like to go to Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driver raised wooden eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere you wish, sir,&rdquo; he answered, in his usual
expressionless voice. &ldquo;When were you thinking of starting,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking of starting at all,&rdquo; said Micky. &ldquo;I
want you to go&ndash;&ndash;alone! You&rsquo;ve been often enough now
not to get lost. Do you think you can manage it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, if you think you can manage without me
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the faintest touch of amazement in the man&rsquo;s
even voice; he knew how helpless Micky was, or pretended
to be&ndash;&ndash;knew how he hated being left to do for
himself.</p>
<p>But Micky only laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can manage all right. I shall probably go away
somewhere myself for a few days. Besides, you won&rsquo;t
be gone long&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Driver.</p>
<p>Micky was leaning against the mantelshelf; his eyes
were all crinkled up into a laugh as if he had heard some
excellent joke which he was about to repeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t be gone long,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;A
couple of days, I should think. You can put up at the
hotel we stayed at last time; they&rsquo;ll look after you, and
the manager speaks English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Driver hesitated. &ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;what were
you wanting me to do when I get there, sir?&rdquo; he asked,
after a moment.</p>
<p>Micky clung to his joke for an instant longer, then
suddenly he let it go.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to post a letter for me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Driver was too well trained to show amazement at
Micky&rsquo;s instructions, but just for a fractional second he
forgot to answer with his usual &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and stood immovable.
Then he recovered himself, and said it twice
with hurried apology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And am I to go at once, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning will do,&rdquo; Micky said. &ldquo;You can
go by the first boat train.&rdquo; He looked at the man anxiously.
He had a sort of uncomfortable feeling that
Driver must be thinking he was not quite right in the
head. After a moment he dismissed him.</p>
<p>Then Micky went over to his desk and rummaged
amongst the many papers and letters there till he found
a sheet of paper embossed with the name of an hotel in
Paris. It had not been used, and Micky heaved a sigh
of relief.</p>
<p>He went to bed late that night. He forgot all about
his promise to go round to the Delands. He spent the
time writing letters and tearing them up again till the
wastepaper basket was full; then he carried it over to
the fireplace and burnt every scrap of paper it contained.</p>
<p>There were two finished letters lying on his desk. One
was sealed and addressed, but not stamped, and the other
was written on a sheet of Driver&rsquo;s plain notepaper, which
Micky folded and unfolded with a sort of nervous dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Its contents were not very long, but they had taken a
good deal of composing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Dear Miss Shepstone</span>,&ndash;&ndash;I received your note in reply to my
letter and cannot help saying that I feel very hurt at your decided
refusal to allow me to take you out. I thought we were to
be friends? Have I been so unfortunate as to offend you? If
so, I can only assure you that it has been utterly unintentional.
Won&rsquo;t you let me see you, if only for a moment? I will meet you
at any time or place.&ndash;&ndash;
                         Yours sincerely, MICKEY MELLOWES.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He gave a dissatisfied growl as he finished reading it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
Not a very eloquent epistle. There was so much more
which he wanted to say, but did not dare to. He folded
it again and thrust it into an envelope; then he addressed
it and laid it beside that other on his desk, comparing the
two handwritings with complacence.</p>
<p>Not in the least alike! Nobody would ever suspect that
they had been written by the same person.</p>
<p>He rang for Driver and gave him the unstamped envelope.
&ldquo;This is what I want you to post in Paris. Mind
you put enough stamps on. You&rsquo;d better have it weighed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Driver looked at the other letter. &ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;is
that for the post too, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky put his hand behind him with a guilty gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ll post that myself,&rdquo; he said, and he went out
then and there into the cold night and did so.</p>
<p>As it dropped into the letter-box Micky looked up at
the stars and sighed.</p>
<p>What the dickens could he have done to make her so
distant? At any rate he would let her see that he was not
to be so easily snubbed. If she didn&rsquo;t answer his letter he
would go boldly round to Elphinstone Road, and stay
there till he saw her.</p>
<p>He was half way to bed before he remembered that he
had promised to go to the Delands that evening. He
stopped short with his necktie half undone and swore.</p>
<p>What the deuce would they think of him?</p>
<p>Well, he would have to plead that headache still, that
was all, and if Marie chose to cut up rough....
Micky felt mean because he rather hoped that she would.
He knew that he wanted their friendship to cease, but,
man-like, he did not altogether like having to take the
initiative. Marie was a nice little girl, and if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for that relative of hers dying on New Year&rsquo;s Eve&ndash;&ndash;well,
he would probably have been engaged to her by
this time.</p>
<p>He went to bed feeling miserable.</p>
<p>Driver had just left the house to catch the boat train
the following morning when June Mason rang Micky up.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Any news for me?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;I hate worrying
you so soon, but Esther&rsquo;s given notice. She&rsquo;s told Mrs.
Elders that she can&rsquo;t afford to stay on. I nearly shook
her this morning. I asked her to let me help her for the
time being. I even said that I would take five per cent.
interest on the hateful money if she was so abominably
proud, and she laughed! She cried the next minute and
said I was much too kind to her, but she wouldn&rsquo;t listen.
What have you done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; said Micky promptly. &ldquo;In a couple of
days&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good man, that&rsquo;s much too long to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best I can do,&rdquo; said Micky rather shortly.
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s a good best if you&rsquo;ll be patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard the sigh she gave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest Injun!&rdquo; he said seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well. If you let me down, Micky&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be let down,&rdquo; Micky said.</p>
<p>June went back to Elphinstone Road with a heavy
heart.</p>
<p>She was very thorough in her friendships, and it really
seemed a terrible thing to her that Esther would not
accept help.</p>
<p>She felt so genuinely fond of the girl herself that she
could not understand the feeling of affection and confidence
not being reciprocated; she went up to her room
and tucked herself into the big armchair amongst the
mauve cushions and smoked innumerable cigarettes. Charlie
was asleep by the fire; he found his way upstairs now
without invitation; he was beginning to get quite respectable-looking;
he had lost his wild, scared look, and even
his purr had taken on a sleekier, smoother sound.</p>
<p>June stared at him for some time, then suddenly she
got up and went downstairs.</p>
<p>She knocked at Esther&rsquo;s door, but there was no answer,
and she went back to her own room dejectedly.</p>
<p>If only Esther were not so proud they might have such
good times together! If only Esther had a little money
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
and could go shares with this room; but what was the
good of wishing? She hurled one of the mauve cushions
across the room, and after that she felt better.</p>
<p>She went down to lunch because she hoped Esther
would be there, but she was not. The long room was
rather empty, and June ate her cold meat and pudding
hurriedly and went back upstairs.</p>
<p>It was getting dusk when she heard Esther come in;
she waited eagerly, but the footsteps did not come on to
her door. June threw another cushion across the room
to keep the other company; it was her chief vent for
anger or irritation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confounded pride,&rdquo; she said under her breath. She
paced up and down for some minutes, then she caught
Charlie up from his cushion and went downstairs to Esther&rsquo;s
room with him in her arms.</p>
<p>Her knock was answered immediately and Esther stood
there in the doorway.</p>
<p>June spoke without looking at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought Charlie down&ndash;&ndash;I thought if he stayed up
in my room any longer you&rsquo;d be wanting to pay me for
his board and lodging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thrust the cat into Esther&rsquo;s arms and turned away.</p>
<p>She was feeling very sore; hers was such a generous
nature that she could not understand why Esther could
not see how glad she would have been to help her; she
went back to her own room and slammed the door.</p>
<p>A moment later she was sorry for what she had done;
twice she went half way down the stairs to apologise,
then came back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do her good,&rdquo; she told herself snappishly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no
patience with such silly pride, and as for you, my boy,&rdquo;
she stopped and shook her fist at Micky&rsquo;s photograph,
&ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t buck up and find her something....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two days dragged away. June purposely avoided
Esther; she never went into the dining-room to meals,
and Esther never came upstairs to June&rsquo;s room; there
was a kind of armed neutrality between them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>Charlie, too, seemed to have been told to keep away,
and June missed his lusty purr in the silent room.</p>
<p>She shed a few tears into the mauve cushions; she
thought Esther was wilfully misunderstanding her; she
wrote to Micky on the second day with a great deal of
emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you dead or asleep? Here am I, just living to
hear from you, and you leave me without a word! Esther
and I haven&rsquo;t spoken for two days, not that you care, of
course. You don&rsquo;t believe in my friendships, I know, but
it&rsquo;s a very serious thing for me. I&rsquo;m more fond of that
girl than I&rsquo;ve ever been of anybody, and now she&rsquo;ll walk
out of this house and my life, and it will be your
fault....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew this was unfair to Micky, but she knew that
Micky would understand&ndash;&ndash;Micky always understood.</p>
<p>But Micky frowned over the letter. Did she imagine
he enjoyed sitting down here doing nothing? What pleasure
did she suppose he was getting out of the whole
thing?</p>
<p>He threw the letter into the fire. Something ought to
happen to-morrow, anyway. The last two days had
seemed like months.</p>
<p>To kill time he went round to the Delands. He felt a
little nervous as he reached the house. It seemed an unconscionable
time since he was last here. When the butler
opened the door he felt an insane desire to say, &ldquo;Good
evening, Jessop! You&rsquo;re still here, then.&rdquo; Such a decade
ago it seemed since Jessop had been wont to admit him
without question and take his hat and coat.</p>
<p>But Jessop did not smile to-night, and did not move
back an inch when he saw who was the caller.</p>
<p>Micky was nonplussed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&ndash;&ndash;anybody in?&rdquo; he asked awkwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; the mistress and the young ladies are all out,
sir....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; There was a little silence; then Micky turned
on his heel. &ldquo;Well, good-night!&rdquo; he said jerkily.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>He walked away, not sure if he was relieved or disappointed.
A few yards down the road he almost cannoned
into a man he knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Philips! Where are you off to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philips stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Micky! Not coming my way? I&rsquo;m going to
the Delands. What&rsquo;s up with you? Haven&rsquo;t seen you for
a week or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been seedy,&rdquo; Micky said hurriedly. &ldquo;And the
Delands are out. I&rsquo;ve just called there myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; Philips tried hard to see his face through the
darkness. &ldquo;Rot,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a musical
evening on&ndash;&ndash;I had a special invite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky said nothing. This was a nasty blow; apparently
the Delands were only &ldquo;not at home&rdquo; to him. Jove!
he must have behaved caddishly. He walked on feeling
very subdued. Had he quite lost his wits, he wondered,
that for the sake of a girl who would have none of him
he was willing to offend all his old friends? He tried
to look at his behaviour from Marie Deland&rsquo;s point of
view. Yes, it must look pretty rotten, he was forced
to admit.</p>
<p>He thought about it all the time he walked home. He
asked himself honestly if this new game was worth the
candle.</p>
<p>Esther loved another man.</p>
<p>Already she had shown him that she cared nothing for
him or his friendship, and yet&ndash;&ndash;yet&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Micky set his
teeth. He had never wanted anything really badly in
all his life before, but now he wanted this girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not done yet, anyway,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;After
all&ndash;&ndash;let the best man win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt that he had decided a question of great importance
as he went back to his rooms; it was a pleasant
surprise to find Driver there; Micky beamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got back, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man took Micky&rsquo;s hat and coat, and turned to go.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>Micky stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything all right?&rdquo; he asked, with a touch of anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You posted the letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, and had it weighed....&rdquo; There was a
little pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; Micky asked. &ldquo;Nothing else happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man raised his expressionless eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have got in this morning, sir, but we had a
rough crossing, and I was ill&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Driver!&ndash;&ndash;anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&ndash;&ndash;I met Mr. Ashton in Paris. He seemed very
surprised to see me there without you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky&rsquo;s face changed; he had not counted on this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell him you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driver raised his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never tell anybody anything, sir,&rdquo; he said woodenly.</p>
<p>Micky breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good man.... He was alone, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone at the hotel, but I saw him out driving twice
with the same lady, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw him out twice&ndash;&ndash;driving with the same lady?&rdquo;
Micky echoed the man&rsquo;s words vaguely. &ldquo;All right&ndash;&ndash;you
can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo; Driver departed, closing the door
noiselessly.</p>
<p>Ashton had soon found consolation, Micky thought
savagely. He wondered what Esther would say if she
could know. What was Driver thinking about it all?
Driver was safe as the Bank of England; but, all the
same, it was not altogether pleasant to feel that he had
had to give himself away to his valet.</p>
<p>He looked up at the clock. Past nine! So there
would not be another post in to-night.</p>
<p>Esther had not answered his note, and two whole days
had elapsed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>Micky began pacing the room. Why had she so suddenly
thrown him over, he wondered miserably.</p>
<p>He could not imagine what he had done to offend her.</p>
<p>He hardly knew how the days had passed since New
Year&rsquo;s Eve. He had not visited any of his old haunts or
seen any of his friends. It almost seemed as if he had
opened the book of a new life and forgotten about the old.</p>
<p>She might have answered his letter. Dash it all! he
wasn&rsquo;t just a bounder who had spoken to her for his
own amusement. He kicked a hassock out of his way
and went to bed.</p>
<p>If he didn&rsquo;t hear in the morning, he would risk it and
go round to see her. At the worst she could only have
the door shut in his face....</p>
<p>&ldquo;And even then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he told his reflection in the mirror
fiercely, as he struggled with a stud. &ldquo;Even then I&rsquo;m
not done&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;ll show her that I&rsquo;m not....&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>June Mason was mixing perfume the following morning
when a little knock came at her door.</p>
<p>She looked up from her work and listened; after a
second she resumed her occupation briskly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She did not raise her eyes when the door opened,
though she knew quite well who had entered the room,
and for a second Esther Shepstone stood on the threshold
hesitatingly, then she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>June Mason looked up with an exaggerated start; she
was a picturesque figure at that moment in a big white
overall, and with a scarf of her favourite mauve tied
over her dark head.</p>
<p>She held a little phial in either hand, and there was
a delicious faint smell of rose perfume in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Gracious! I thought you were dead
and buried long enough ago. Oh yes, come in....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
You don&rsquo;t mind me going on with my work, do you?
I&rsquo;m up to my eyes in it.... Sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Esther stood where she was, the eagerness died
out of her pretty face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stay if you&rsquo;re busy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come
another time, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she hesitated. Across the room
the eyes of the two girls met, and June Mason promptly
put down the two little phials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in and apologise, and so will I,&rdquo; she said heartily.
&ldquo;There!&rdquo; She reached up&ndash;&ndash;Esther was taller than
she&ndash;&ndash;and gave the younger girl a sounding kiss. &ldquo;There!
I don&rsquo;t often kiss people, so you can consider yourself
flattered.&rdquo; She dragged forward a chair and pushed
Esther into it. &ldquo;Now, what do you want, and where&rsquo;s
that Charlie? You&rsquo;ve no idea how I&rsquo;ve missed him.
No&ndash;&ndash;you stay there, and I&rsquo;ll go and fetch him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She darted off, and returned a moment later with
Charlie in her arms. There were yards of mauve ribbon
lying on the table and she cut off a length and tied
it in a bow round his neck; then she kissed his head
and dropped him on to his cushion. &ldquo;There! Now, we&rsquo;re
quite at home again,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And now, fire away and
tell me why you&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She packed all the dishes and boxes on to a tray, put
them out of sight behind a screen and came back to the
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like this perfume? It&rsquo;s something new! I&rsquo;m
trying to blend it with white rose. Isn&rsquo;t it gorgeous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo; said Esther. She consented to have her
chin dabbed. &ldquo;What are you making now?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Miss Mason chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m only experimising, as Micky calls it,&rdquo; she
said lightly. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to talk shop. You&rsquo;ve got
some news; I can see by your face that you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther laughed and flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have,&rdquo; she said tremulously. &ldquo;Such wonderful
news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said June drily. &ldquo;From the young man, of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
course? Well, is he on his way home, and have you got
to get a wedding dress in the next five minutes or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, it isn&rsquo;t anything like that,&rdquo; said Esther. There
was a shade of regret in her voice. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s in Paris&ndash;&ndash;he
says he&rsquo;s not staying there, but he had to pay a business
call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June gave a rather unladylike sniff, but Esther was too
engrossed to notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to have been very lucky,&rdquo; she went on.
&ldquo;He hadn&rsquo;t got very much money when he went away,
but he&rsquo;s got some appointment now; he does not say
what and....&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she gave a little excited laugh&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;he
says that he&rsquo;s going to send me &pound;3 a week for as long
as he is away.... Isn&rsquo;t it wonderfully good of
him? I suppose I ought not to take it, but he says that
if things had turned out as he hoped, we should have
been married, and so ... you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
wrong of me to take it, do you?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>June rose to her feet. She looked chagrined; she had
been so sure that this man was a rotter, that it was a
bit of a set-back to hear this news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take it, my dear, and don&rsquo;t be a goose,&rdquo; she said
promptly. &ldquo;As he says, if you were his wife you&rsquo;d take
it, and as you&rsquo;re going to be married, it&rsquo;s quite the right
thing if he&rsquo;s well off that he should help you! I hope
you won&rsquo;t let your silly pride make you send it back;
you&rsquo;d only hurt his feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that for anything,&rdquo; Esther said quickly.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s such a lot of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; said June. &ldquo;Why, Micky Mellowes
wouldn&rsquo;t even stop to pick it up if he dropped it in the
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not all millionaires like Mr. Mellowes,&rdquo; Esther
said sharply. &ldquo;And he ought to be ashamed of himself
if he really wouldn&rsquo;t stop to pick it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you take things so literally, my dear,&rdquo; she said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t like Micky, though you&rsquo;ve never seen
him, but I&rsquo;m going to ask him here to tea one day, if he&rsquo;ll
come&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose he will,&rdquo; said Esther. &ldquo;Elphinstone
Road wouldn&rsquo;t be good enough for him, would it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>June frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to hear you talk like that about Micky!
It&rsquo;s not fair, when you don&rsquo;t know him. I tell you he&rsquo;s
one of the best&ndash;&ndash;and, anyway, as he&rsquo;s a friend of
mine&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d no right to have said anything about
him at all; please forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; June said laconically. &ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t
a bit of a snob; he&rsquo;d do anything in the world for anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther glanced up at his portrait on the shelf. She felt
a trifle ashamed of what she had said; after all, Micky
had been good to her in his own way, even if his own
way had been patronising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I shall stay on here,&rdquo; she said, after a moment.
&ldquo;And if you think you would still like me to share
this room&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>June pounced upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You darling! It&rsquo;s too good to be true. Of course, I
should love it! I&rsquo;ll go and tell old Mother Elders straight
away; it will put her in a good temper for a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s out,&rdquo; Esther said quickly. &ldquo;I went to tell her
myself as soon as I got my letter.... It only came
this morning.&rdquo; She coloured sensitively beneath June&rsquo;s
quizzical eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course you&rsquo;ve been devouring it ever since,&rdquo;
June said. &ldquo;Well, and very nice too! There&rsquo;s nothing
to be ashamed of. I&rsquo;ll admit that I didn&rsquo;t think somehow
that he could be a very nice sort of person, this young
man of yours. No, I don&rsquo;t know why I thought so&ndash;&ndash;just
an idea of mine. I get hold of ideas like that. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
I&rsquo;ve changed my mind now; I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s a dear, or
you&rsquo;d never look so happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should love you to see him,&rdquo; Esther said with enthusiasm.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you would like him. I don&rsquo;t know
his people, of course&ndash;&ndash;I suppose if they thought he cared
for me they&rsquo;d be angry&ndash;&ndash;but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter, and
I know he doesn&rsquo;t care at all for his mother....&rdquo;</p>
<p>June looked up from stroking Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I wish you hadn&rsquo;t said that,&rdquo; she said frankly.
&ldquo;No man can be really nice who doesn&rsquo;t love his own
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther looked distressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s horrid!&rdquo; she said eagerly. &ldquo;He has told me
how horrid she is to him&ndash;&ndash;really she is&ndash;&ndash;and as he&rsquo;s her
only son&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She stopped. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; she went on,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no law to make you like a woman just because
you happen to be her son, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unnatural not to,&rdquo; June answered shortly. &ldquo;However,
as neither of us know his mother, we&rsquo;ll give him
the benefit of the doubt. She may be a perfect old cat.
Some women are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wandered round the room to find a cigarette, and
Esther sat looking into the fire.</p>
<p>She could not remember her own mother. But somehow
she felt sure that, had she been living, she would
have adored her.</p>
<p>She had never heard Raymond say anything nice of
Mrs. Ashton&ndash;&ndash;he had always spoken about her in a bitter,
half sneering way.</p>
<p>She looked across to June timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you always judge people by what you call &lsquo;instinct&rsquo;?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;When I first knew you you told
me that you felt sure you would like me before ever you
saw me, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was right,&rdquo; June said triumphantly. &ldquo;I nearly
always am right when I get an instinct about anything.
Micky says it&rsquo;s all rot!&ndash;&ndash;there I am, talking about him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
again&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s a habit, so don&rsquo;t notice it! But even he has
to admit how often I am right; I could give you dozens
of instances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther did not pursue the subject; she was remembering
how June had said that she had an &ldquo;instinct&rdquo; that
Raymond was not nice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re the most original person I&rsquo;ve ever met,&rdquo;
she said with a little smile.</p>
<p>June laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eccentric, Micky says I am&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she answered, then
broke off with a comical look of despair. &ldquo;You really
must excuse me for everlastingly dragging him in,&rdquo; she
apologised. &ldquo;As I said before, it&rsquo;s a habit&ndash;&ndash;and there
goes the dinner gong. Are we going to feed here to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther rose from the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m hungry, so I do hope there&rsquo;s
something nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went down together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curry,&rdquo; said June, sniffing the air critically. &ldquo;The
colonel will be pleased; he&rsquo;s always telling us how they
used to make curry in India, poor old chap! Though
I don&rsquo;t think any of us really believe that he&rsquo;s ever been
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the colonel was not there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s ill,&rdquo; so young Harley told the two girls as they
sat down at their table. &ldquo;I went up to see him this morning,
and he really looks ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look in exactly rude health yourself,&rdquo; said
June in her blunt fashion. She noticed that Harley
looked at Esther a great deal, and she made up her mind
to tell him at the earliest opportunity that Esther was
engaged. June scented romance everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are the first violets I have seen this year,&rdquo; Esther
was saying, looking at a little bunch the young man
wore in his coat.</p>
<p>He took them out eagerly and laid them down beside
her plate.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do have them, will you? I never wear flowers really,
but a girl in the street begged me to buy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther took them up eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are my favourite flowers,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I
haven&rsquo;t had any given to me for&ndash;&ndash;oh, for ever so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It gave her a little pang to remember that Ashton had
always brought her violets in the first days of their acquaintance.
It was one of the many little attentions which
he had gradually dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to let Mr. Harley fall in love with you,
mind,&rdquo; June said severely as they went upstairs after
dinner. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s much too nice to be made unhappy&ndash;&ndash;even
by you,&rdquo; she added affectionately.</p>
<p>Esther stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, whatever do you mean?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I never
see him or speak to him, except at meal times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean what I say,&rdquo; June insisted. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see
how he looked at you when you took his violets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther flushed with vexation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what perfect nonsense!&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>But June only laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Onlookers see most of the game,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming up to my room? Our room, I
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go out&ndash;&ndash;I had an appointment at half-past
two, but I&rsquo;ll love to come to tea with you,&rdquo; she
added, seeing the disappointment in June&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, four o&rsquo;clock. But who is the appointment
with? You won&rsquo;t need to find a berth now.
You&rsquo;re a lady of leisure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall try all the same. I don&rsquo;t mean to be
lazy just because he&rsquo;s so good to me. I shall save all
I can. I went to an agency yesterday&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll rob you,&rdquo; June protested. &ldquo;They always do.
I know what agents are,&rdquo; she added darkly.</p>
<p>Esther laughed.</p>
<p>But if she had hoped great things from her call that
afternoon she was disappointed. The thin, aristocratic-looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
person who owned the &ldquo;Bureau,&rdquo; as it was called,
looked at her with coldly critical eyes, and said that she
had no vacancies likely to suit her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you told me to call,&rdquo; Esther protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; there might have been something,&rdquo; was all
the answer she received. &ldquo;Call again to-morrow, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther went out dispiritedly. There were so many
girls of her own class and age in the bare waiting-room;
she felt quite sure that they would all get berths before
she had a chance.</p>
<p>She felt glad that she had June Mason to go back to.
June was always sympathetic. She went straight upstairs
to the sitting-room with the mauve cushions.</p>
<p>June opened the door before she had time to knock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was you. I heard your step. What&rsquo;s
the matter? You sounded dispirited as you came upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you must have second sight, or whatever
they call it. But you&rsquo;re right this time; I am rather down
on my luck. They haven&rsquo;t anything at the agency to
suit me. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She stopped, looking past June into
the cosy room to where a man had just risen from a
chair by the fire&ndash;&ndash;a tall man&ndash;&ndash;who looked across at her
with eyes that were half-abashed, half-defiant. Micky
Mellowes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p>June introduced Micky and Esther with a sort of
hurried self-consciousness. It was not by her invitation
that Micky was here this afternoon, and the
fact that she had asked him to help Esther embarrassed
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mellowes&ndash;&ndash;Miss Shepstone; you&rsquo;ve both heard of
each other, so I can leave you to entertain one another
while I get tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she bolted out of the room.</p>
<p>Esther looked after her with angry eyes; she thought
June might have stayed&ndash;&ndash;she took a quick step forward
to call her back, but Micky stopped her; he put a hand on
the door above her head, shutting it fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to speak to you, whether you like it or not,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>She faced him angrily; she was very flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean. You&rsquo;ve no right to
speak to me like that. If Miss Mason has asked you
here to meet me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;June didn&rsquo;t know I was coming. She has no more
idea than the dead that we have ever met before. I
haven&rsquo;t told her, and I don&rsquo;t suppose you have&ndash;&ndash;or will,&rdquo;
he added grimly. &ldquo;However, as we are alone, will you
tell me what I&rsquo;ve done to offend you? It&rsquo;s not fair to
take me for a friend and then fling me over as if I were
an old glove.... If I&rsquo;ve annoyed you, the least you
can do is to tell me how and give me a chance to explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther had walked back to the fire and Mellowes followed
her. He knew that he had only got a few moments,
and he meant to make the most of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You refuse to see me or to allow me to take you out,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
he went on urgently. &ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t even answered
my last letter. If I have offended you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Esther, as he paused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at
all offended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why, in the name of all that&rsquo;s holy&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he began
again, in exasperation. She cut him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me the truth about yourself. You made
out you were poor! You pretended to be some one quite
different to what you are. You&rsquo;ve a perfect right to, I
suppose, if you wish, but I hate being deceived and
treated like that. I suppose you think anything is good
enough for me! Perhaps it is, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky brought his fist down with a bang on the back
of the big armchair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give you my word of honour, Miss Shepstone, that
what I said was only because it seemed the best way to
make you trust me. I had absolutely no other reason for
pretending to&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;be anything but what I am. I know
you&rsquo;d have gone off at a tangent if I&rsquo;d said I was unfortunate
enough to be rich, I know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t even write to me from your real address&ndash;&ndash;you
just put a number.&rdquo; She broke into an angry little
laugh. &ldquo;I suppose you thought I shouldn&rsquo;t understand
that a number can also be an expensive flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky turned pale with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re deliberately trying to make out that I&rsquo;m a
bounder. It&rsquo;s not fair&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t deserve it; and as to thinking
anything good enough for you&ndash;&ndash;I suppose you&rsquo;d only
take it as a fresh insult if I told you that there is nothing
in the world I consider good enough for you.... I
... oh, what&rsquo;s the good of arguing,&rdquo; he broke out
with sudden rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good at all, and there&rsquo;s nothing to argue about,&rdquo;
Esther said stiffly. She had taken off her gloves and was
flattening them out nervously. &ldquo;You offered me your
friendship, and now I decline it. I suppose I am free
to do so?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Micky violently, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not ... I&ndash;&ndash;I
...&rdquo; He turned away sharply, realising with
dismay how nearly he had blurted out the truth about
Ashton. After a moment he spoke more quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is pure chance that brought me here. I have known
June Mason for years; we are old friends. She has no
idea that I have ever seen you before, but I will tell her
this moment if you wish it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised passionate eyes to his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will never forgive you as long as I live if you dare
to,&rdquo; she said stormily.</p>
<p>Micky frowned till his brows nearly met above his
kind eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever I say or offer to do is wrong, of course,&rdquo;
he said savagely. &ldquo;If I had not offered to tell her, you
would probably have said that I was ashamed of knowing
you ... oh, good Heavens! whatever have I said
now?&rdquo; he added as he saw the hot blood rush to her face.</p>
<p>He went over to her and tried to take her hand. &ldquo;Do
forgive me; I beg of you to forgive me&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m a clumsy
idiot&ndash;&ndash;but you don&rsquo;t know how hurt I&rsquo;ve felt about being
turned down in this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s absurd to feel hurt&ndash;&ndash;I haven&rsquo;t turned you down;
I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t keep saying that I have. Why I&ndash;&ndash;I
hardly know you,&rdquo; she added with a little angry laugh.</p>
<p>Micky turned away; he stood staring down into the
fire; neither of them spoke again till June returned.</p>
<p>She carried a tray of cakes and hot toast; she set it
down with a thump on the round table by the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I coaxed it out of Mrs. Elders,&rdquo; she explained breathlessly.
&ldquo;I generally keep some cake up here myself, but
I haven&rsquo;t got a bit to-day. Esther, fetch the cloth, there&rsquo;s
a dear; and, Micky, you put the kettle on&ndash;&ndash;I have filled
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bustled about, talking the whole time; if she noticed
the constraint between the other two she said nothing
till tea was ready, and she sat down amongst the
mauve cushions with a breathless sigh.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re going to be cosy. Well, and how have
you two been getting on? Micky, I&rsquo;ve told Esther so
much about you, she&rsquo;s sick to death of the sound of your
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said so,&rdquo; Esther protested quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have some cake,&rdquo; Micky said; he deposited a slice on
June&rsquo;s plate and adroitly changed the subject. He was
furiously angry; he had not believed that Esther had it
in her to turn on him as she had done. But the more she
snubbed him, the more determined he was not to be
snubbed. As he sat there stirring his tea and listening to
June&rsquo;s chatter he was watching Esther all the time.</p>
<p>She had taken off her coat now. He wondered if it was
the coat his money had bought her; it was not half good
enough, anyway. He thought of the furs and expensive
gloves which Marie Deland wore, and he longed to be able
to give some to this little girl who sat there with such
angry defiance in her eyes.</p>
<p>He realised that this pride of hers was going to be
the hardest barrier of all between them.</p>
<p>She could not forgive him because he was a rich man
and had pretended to be poor; she could not forget that
he had paid for her dinner and a saucer of milk for the
cat. He looked down to where Charlie sat blinking in
the firelight, and a little smile crossed his face. He wondered
if perhaps some day soon she would offer to repay
him for that night&ndash;&ndash;if she would insist on doing so, as
she had insisted on paying her share of everything with
June.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More tea?&rdquo; June demanded across the table, and
Micky said, &ldquo;Oh&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;yes, thanks,&rdquo; hurriedly. As long as
the meal was unfinished Esther would have to stay in the
room, he thought; she could not very well leave before;
but in this he was mistaken, for Esther put her cup down
almost at once and looked at June.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you think me very rude if I run away?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to see Mrs. Elders and tell her I am staying
on&ndash;&ndash;I think she has been trying to let my room.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>June looked disappointed. &ldquo;Oh, well, if you really must
go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come back when you&rsquo;ve seen her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Esther. She turned to Micky, who
had risen. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say good-bye, then,&rdquo; she said with an
effort to speak lightly.</p>
<p>He held open the door for her, and a moment later
she had gone. As soon as he came back to his chair June
rounded on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you said to annoy her?&rdquo; She looked quite
angry! &ldquo;I wanted you to like each other. Really, Micky,
you are the limit! She won&rsquo;t come back again, you see
if she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Micky. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she will.&rdquo; He
laughed a rather chagrined laugh. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said anything
as far as I know,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve
said, I fancy. You&rsquo;ve fed her up with accounts of what
a wonderful person I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are,&rdquo; said June.</p>
<p>He frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of you to think so, but I don&rsquo;t know anybody
else who shares your opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t help the world being full of idiots, can
I?&rdquo; she demanded in exasperation. &ldquo;And, Micky, why
did you come here to-day? When I asked you before you
said you didn&rsquo;t want to come; you&rsquo;ve soon changed your
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to tell you about Miss Shepstone. You asked
me to get her a berth....&rdquo;</p>
<p>June laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, you&rsquo;re too late! She doesn&rsquo;t want your
help now, or mine either, for that matter,&rdquo; she added
ruefully. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a lady of means&ndash;&ndash;that wonderful man
of hers who&rsquo;s tucked up in Paris having the time of his
life is going to allow her three pounds a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused and looked across at him expectantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you look surprised?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Micky swallowed hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am surprised!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Too jolly surprised for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
anything. It&rsquo;s good news, eh? I suppose she was
pleased....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she was! She&rsquo;s staying on now, and is
going to share my room. She had a qualm just for a
moment, as to whether she ought to take the money, but
I soon put her mind at ease. &lsquo;Take all you can get, my
dear,&rsquo; I said. After all, I dare say if the man&rsquo;s giving
her three pounds he could afford to give her about double
that amount; men are not particularly generous from
what I know of them&ndash;&ndash;except you, Micky....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky got red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But three pounds a week is enough to live on? Don&rsquo;t
you think it is?&rdquo; he asked, with a touch of anxiety in his
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to live here on,&rdquo; June admitted. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
not great wealth. Still, she&rsquo;s going to get a berth as
well, so perhaps, after all, the one you&rsquo;ve heard of will
suit her. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky was stooping, patting Charlie&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in an office,&rdquo; he said, after a moment; his voice
sounded a little uncertain. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would really
suit her, though&ndash;&ndash;now I&rsquo;ve seen her,&rdquo; he hastened to add.
&ldquo;It would be too hard work&ndash;&ndash;late hours and all the rest
of it, dontcherknow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June looked at his bent head shrewdly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s just as well this
phantom lover of Esther&rsquo;s has turned up trumps, if that&rsquo;s
all you&rsquo;d got to offer her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phantom lover!&rdquo; said Micky; his voice sounded as if
he were annoyed. &ldquo;Whom are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther&rsquo;s beloved,&rdquo; June said airily. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t tell
me his name, so I call him the phantom lover, because
I&rsquo;ve got an eerie sort of feeling in my mind about him
that he doesn&rsquo;t really exist. What do you think, Micky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, how can I possibly know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>June produced some cigarettes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he were all that she&rsquo;d like me to believe he is,&rdquo;
she said shrewdly, &ldquo;she&rsquo;d tell me more about him. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
certainly got a bit more confidential to-day, and said that
he had a cat for a mother and a few things like that.
She had another letter from him this morning; he&rsquo;s in
Paris&ndash;&ndash;on business, so he tells her.&rdquo; She laughed, turning
her face for a moment against the mauve cushion.
Suddenly she sat upright again, &ldquo;Micky, I should hate
that man if I knew him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another of your &lsquo;instinctive hates&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked whimsically.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t believe in them, but....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; said Micky thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure.&rdquo;
He looked at his watch. &ldquo;Well, I must be trotting.
There&rsquo;s nothing else I can do for you, I suppose? No
more waifs who want billets...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re laughing at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&ndash;&ndash;I never laugh at you.&rdquo; He laid his hand on
her shoulder for a moment. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother to get up;
you look so comfortable ... Good-bye&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye&ndash;&ndash;and, Micky, don&rsquo;t make up your mind not
to like Esther just because of this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I never thought of such a thing,&rdquo; he protested
lamely.</p>
<p>June snuggled more cosily into the cushions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I know what you are,&rdquo; she said, for once
hopelessly on the wrong track.</p>
<p>Micky laughed to himself as he went down the stairs;
he wondered if he was getting clever, or if June was not
so quick to see a thing as he had believed, that she had
not noticed the constraint between himself and Esther.</p>
<p>He looked about him eagerly as he went out, hoping
to catch a glimpse of Esther, but the house seemed deserted,
quite different from what he had pictured it to be.
He had always thought that a London boarding-house
must be noisy and crowded and perpetually smelling of
soap and cabbage water; he was relieved to find that this
was fairly comfortable and quiet.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>He picked up a taxicab at the corner of the road and
was driven back to his flat. He felt very depressed.
Everybody seemed to have interests in life except himself.
He wished he had got married years ago and settled
down. He thought of Marie Deland with remorseful
affection. Here was another woman who must be
thinking him a positive outsider. How in the world did
a man put an end to a flirtation that was growing rapidly
into something else without hurting a woman&rsquo;s feelings,
he wondered.</p>
<p>Ashton had accomplished it quite successfully several
times. Micky sighed, and let himself into his flat.</p>
<p>There were several letters lying on the table; he flicked
them through disinterestedly; then he stopped&ndash;&ndash;the last
one was from Ashton.</p>
<p>Micky stood for quite a minute staring down at the
handwriting, which he had been at such pains to copy.
Then he ripped open the envelope.</p>
<p>Ashton wrote from Paris:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Dear Mickey</span>,&ndash;&ndash;Just a line to send you my address, as promised.
Hope things are going well with you. I am staying on
here for the present, as I have run up against Maisie Clare&ndash;&ndash;you
remember her, Tubby Clare&rsquo;s little widow? My son, she&rsquo;s got
pots of money, and at the present moment things are looking
promising! The mater would be pleased if I could manage to
pull it off. By the way, I dare say Driver told you I met him
the other day&ndash;&ndash;he was very mysterious and hadn&rsquo;t a word to say!
Surely he wasn&rsquo;t joy-riding over here by himself? Remember
me to every one.&ndash;&ndash;Yours, <span class='smcap'>R. F. Ashton</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And not one word about Esther! Not a single mention
of the girl who was thinking of him night and day,
and only living to see him again.</p>
<p>Micky crushed the letter and tossed it into the fire.
That settled it, he told himself; he no longer had the
slightest compunction in cutting Ashton out; the fellow
was not worth a moment&rsquo;s consideration.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p>Esther trudged to and fro from the agency where
the stiff and stately lady presided so many times
during the next few days that she began to hate the
sight of the tall building and the dark stairs covered with
worn linoleum.</p>
<p>Every day the waiting-room seemed crowded with
girls, many of whom were a great deal more shabby and
hopeless looking than she was, and they all sat patiently
on the wooden chairs and eyed one another with a sort of
jealous suspicion till their turn came to pass within the
magic portal which guarded the stiff and stately lady
from the vulgar gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you an agency wouldn&rsquo;t be any good,&rdquo; June
Mason said when Esther came home after another fruitless
journey. &ldquo;They take your money and forget you
till you turn up to remind them that you&rsquo;re still in existence.
Give it up, my dear, and come into partnership
with me. I should love to take you round to all the big
stores and tell them that you owe your milk and rose
complexion to my famous cream.&rdquo; She burst out laughing.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you imagine it! Esther, you and I ought to
tour the country in a caravan or something. Call ourselves
the new Sequah.&rdquo; She rolled over in the big chair
and hid her face in the cushions.</p>
<p>Esther laughed; she felt quite at home now in June&rsquo;s
room. There were a few of her own possessions lying
about, and she had bought Charlie a new cushion of his
own. It gave her a sense of independence to know that
she was paying her share of everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall get something if I wait long enough,&rdquo; Esther
said presently. &ldquo;Do you know, I rather think I should
like to be a companion, after all. I told Mr.&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
stopped; she had been about to add that she had once
told Micky how she would hate it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might not be so bad,&rdquo; June admitted; &ldquo;but you
want some one with pots of money and a good temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at Esther consideringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t have to be any eligible sons either,&rdquo;
she said bluntly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re much too pretty&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>June dragged Esther to her feet and made her look in
the glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now dare to call it nonsense&ndash;&ndash;look at yourself,&rdquo; she
commanded.</p>
<p>But Esther only looked at June.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next to you,&rdquo; she began, but June cut her short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to try blatant flattery,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>They both laughed at that.</p>
<p>Some one tapped at the door; Lydia, the smiling housemaid,
appeared; she looked at the two girls with a sort of
parental expression; she was very fond of them both,
and never minded how late or how hard she worked to
do little extra jobs for either of them. It was her greatest
pride to stay in when her &ldquo;evening out&rdquo; came and
help June label the little mauve pots; she recommended
the famous cream to all her friends; she was as proud
of it as if it were her own invention.</p>
<p>She carried a note on a tray now, which she handed
to Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it on the hall table, Miss,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It must
have been left by messenger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited a moment to make up the fire and tidy the
hearth; she was always glad of an excuse to stay in the
room; she was never tired of telling her friends what a
pretty room it was&ndash;&ndash;she loved the mauve cushions and
the many photographs.</p>
<p>She went away with a reluctant backward look. June
yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another love-letter?&rdquo; she asked chaffingly. She looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
across at Esther, and was surprised to see the embarrassment
in the girl&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Mr. Harley,&rdquo; she said, in distress. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m
sure I&rsquo;ve never let him think I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She handed the
letter to June. &ldquo;He wants me to go to a theatre with
him,&rdquo; she added in confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should go,&rdquo; said June promptly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
get much fun, and the man knows you&rsquo;re engaged, and if
he likes to chance it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how does he know I&rsquo;m engaged? I&rsquo;ve never
told him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; June said calmly. &ldquo;I saw the way the wind
was blowing and told him to save complications.&rdquo; She
made a little grimace at Esther. &ldquo;And after this note are
you still going to declare that he isn&rsquo;t more than ordinarily
interested? Esther, you&rsquo;re the most unsuspecting
baby&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Say you&rsquo;ll go, of course. There&rsquo;s no harm
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly shall not go,&rdquo; Esther said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
to, for one thing, and, for another, it would not be
fair&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to Mr. Harley?&rdquo; June asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the phantom lover! Oh, I see!&rdquo; said June drily.</p>
<p>Esther coloured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; she said with a touch
of dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you do,&rdquo; June declared. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so angry!
What am I to call him, pray? You haven&rsquo;t told me his
name.&rdquo; She waited, but Esther did not speak. &ldquo;Of
course, if you&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; she added, rather stiffly.</p>
<p>Esther got up and came over to sit on the arm of her
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that I don&rsquo;t want you to know, but&ndash;&ndash;well, I
promised him not to tell any one; you see, his people
would be furious if they knew. After all, I suppose I&rsquo;m
not anybody, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>June pushed her away.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you make me tired!&rdquo; she said crossly. &ldquo;Why will
you insist on belittling yourself? Who on earth is this
wonderful man that he sets himself up for such a model
of superiority? He can&rsquo;t be anybody if he&rsquo;s ashamed of
you. You don&rsquo;t like Micky, I know, but, with all his
money and position, if he loved you he&rsquo;d be only too
proud to shout it from the housetops, and not care a
hang what the world thought. There&rsquo;s no rotten pride
about Micky&ndash;&ndash;if he loved a beggar girl he&rsquo;d be proud of
it.... No, don&rsquo;t say any more, it makes me boil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lit another cigarette and puffed at it furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you&ndash;&ndash;do you think I should go with Mr. Harley,
then?&rdquo; Esther asked presently. Her pretty face was
flushed and troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said June emphatically. &ldquo;I think you
ought to please yourself. I don&rsquo;t want to advise you,
but it does seem to me that you&rsquo;re throwing away any
chance of real happiness for a&ndash;&ndash;for a, what do they call
it?&ndash;&ndash;something beginning with a &lsquo;c&rsquo;....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chimera,&rdquo; said Esther. She sat with downcast eyes
for a moment, then suddenly she began to cry. Perhaps
in her heart she felt in some mysterious way that June
was right, that this girl, with her odd instinct, had put
her hand right on the heart of things, and that her happiness
did not really lie with Raymond Ashton.</p>
<p>And yet she loved him. Night and day he was never
out of her thoughts. She slept with his letters under her
pillow. Since he went away he had done much to blot
out all that had gone before. And yet sometimes the
memory of that past unhappiness, of its disagreements
and quarrels and petty unkindnesses would raise its ugly
head and look at her with a sort of leer as if daring her
to forget entirely.</p>
<p>June was all remorse in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a pig!&rdquo; she said disgustedly. &ldquo;I ought to be
kicked. Why do you let me talk so much? It&rsquo;s awful
cheek of me to dare to criticise you. I&rsquo;ll never do it
again. He may be an angel for all I know. Esther, if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
you don&rsquo;t stop crying I shall cry too, and then there&rsquo;ll be
a nice sort of noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther dried her eyes and laughed shakily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m silly; I don&rsquo;t know why I cried. There&rsquo;s nothing
to cry for,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why women always cry,&rdquo; said June hardily.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>
<p>Esther climbed the stairs of the agency again the
following morning. There was a little feeling of
despondency in her heart. She had slept badly,
and she had not been able to forget what June had said
about Ashton.</p>
<p>Esther was influenced by June&rsquo;s &ldquo;instincts,&rdquo; as she
chose to call them; she knew it was foolish, but the fact
remained all the same.</p>
<p>When she opened the waiting-room door she felt half
inclined to turn and go away again. She would only
meet with the same answer: &ldquo;Nothing that will suit you
to-day, Miss Shepstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for a wonder the room was almost empty, and the
tall and stately one was standing at the communicating
door.</p>
<p>When she saw Esther she came forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was hoping you would call, Miss Shepstone. Will
you come into my room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther&rsquo;s heart leapt. She obeyed eagerly.</p>
<p>A lady was sitting at the table looking rather bored and
irritated.</p>
<p>She was grey-haired and handsome, and most beautifully
dressed. She turned slightly when Esther entered,
and stared at her through her lorgnette, then she looked
at the stiff and stately one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;the young lady?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam&ndash;&ndash;this is Miss Shepstone.&rdquo; The stately
one introduced Esther with a wave of her hand. &ldquo;This
lady, Miss Shepstone, is looking for a companion. Some
one who can work well&ndash;&ndash;and read aloud.&rdquo; She looked
at Esther sharply. &ldquo;Can you read aloud?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>Esther stammered out that she supposed she could,
but ...</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a minor detail,&rdquo; the lady with the lorgnette
interrupted. &ldquo;Miss Shepstone, I am not wanting a companion
in the ordinary sense of the word. That is to
say, I do not want you to be constantly with me. You
will have your own bedroom and sitting-room&ndash;&ndash;and I
shall only want you at certain hours of the day. You
will write letters for me and make yourself generally
useful.&rdquo; She paused, she searched the girl&rsquo;s eager face
through her glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-four,&rdquo; said Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! And what have you done up till now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the workroom at Eldred&rsquo;s. The manager
has promised to give me a reference, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eldred&rsquo;s!&rdquo; the sharp gaze wavered a little. &ldquo;And
why did you leave there, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left to get married, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not married, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor going to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the present, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was cut short again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get used to you and to get you used to
my ways and then for you to leave me,&rdquo; she was told.
&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want a young man constantly dangling
round the house.&rdquo; Her voice was sharp, but not unkind,
and there was a smile in the keen eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Esther. &ldquo;I quite understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the owner of the lorgnette then, &ldquo;what
do you think about it? Do you think you would like to
come? Do you think you would like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther smiled, there was something in this blunt questioning
that reminded her of June Mason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think I should, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I hate that word,&rdquo; she was told promptly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want any &lsquo;buts&rsquo; in the question. You either wish to come
or you do not. I will give you fifty pounds a year, and
your keep, of course. It&rsquo;s too much for an inexperienced
girl like you, but I think I shall rather like you. Well,
what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther did not know what to say. The offer was
tempting enough, but she thought of June Mason and the
room with the mauve cushions where she was settling
down so happily, and her heart sank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to think it over,&rdquo; she said, stammering.
&ldquo;I have a friend I should like to talk it over with if you
don&rsquo;t mind. If you will give me just a day or two....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a week by all means. I am going away myself
for a few days, and I shan&rsquo;t want you till I come back.
Write and tell me what you decide to do. Here is my
card....&rdquo; She took one from a heavy silver case
and laid it on the table. She looked at Esther quizzically,
then suddenly she held out her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Miss Shepstone. I hope I shall see you
again,&rdquo; and the next moment she had gone.</p>
<p>The stiff and stately owner of the agency was smiling,
well pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are most fortunate, Miss Shepstone,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You have secured one of the best posts I have on my
books. If you take my advice you will not hesitate.
Make up your mind at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther did not answer. She took up the card from
the table, then she drew in her breath with a hard sound,
for the name printed there was Mrs. Raymond Ashton.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>
<p>Esther never knew how she got out into the street.
She walked along like some one in a dream; her
cheeks were burning hot.</p>
<p>Mrs. Raymond Ashton! Raymond&rsquo;s mother! The
woman of whom he had spoken so often and so bitterly.
The woman who had raised such a fierce objection to
her marriage with Raymond.</p>
<p>There was not much resemblance between mother and
son; they were both handsome, but there was a sort of
humour in Mrs. Ashton&rsquo;s face which Raymond&rsquo;s lacked.
Esther tried vainly to find some likeness between them.</p>
<p>She realised how different this woman was to what
she had pictured her, remembered that spontaneously offered
hand. Had Mrs. Ashton known who she was?
Oh, surely not, or she would never have appeared so
anxious to engage her.</p>
<p>How angry Raymond would be. Angry that the woman
he loved was to go to his mother as a paid companion.
Esther could not help smiling. For her own sake
she would not mind it. At least she would be with his
mother and in his home; but, of course, the thing was
impossible&ndash;&ndash;such a situation would not be tolerable. She
would have to write and refuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon!&rdquo; said a voice, and, turning hurriedly,
Esther found Micky Mellowes beside her.</p>
<p>He looked as if he were not quite sure of his reception;
but to-day Esther had other thoughts to occupy her
which were more interesting than he was&ndash;&ndash;and the smile
she gave him was almost friendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon! Isn&rsquo;t it cold?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Very.... Where are you hurrying off to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to speak casually, but his heart was beating
uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going back home,&rdquo; Esther said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
to an agency looking for a berth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A berth!&rdquo; A frown came between his eyes. &ldquo;What
sort of a berth?&rdquo; he asked quickly.</p>
<p>Esther laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m think of taking your advice&ndash;&ndash;and going as
companion to an old lady&ndash;&ndash;not that she&rsquo;s very old,&rdquo; she
added doubtfully, with sudden memory of Raymond&rsquo;s
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that you have decided?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have the refusal of it.&rdquo; She looked at him
with defiant eyes. &ldquo;I am only just hesitating&ndash;&ndash;I want
to talk to Miss Mason about it&ndash;&ndash;she is much more worldly
wise than I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;June is a very sensible woman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am glad
you like her.&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;And the&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;post?&rdquo; he
asked with an effort. &ldquo;Will it be in town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was obviously not going to tell him any more, but
Micky persevered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it is likely to be any one I know. I have
quite an extensive acquaintance in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Esther. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t suppose you will
know these people, anyway,&rdquo; she added with an unconscious
touch of loftiness in her voice. &ldquo;The name is
Ashton&ndash;&ndash;Mrs. Raymond Ashton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the barest possible silence before Micky
answered, a silence during which the blank dismay and
anger that crossed his face would have been amusing had
it not also had something of pathos in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ashton?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I know Raymond Ashton
very well.&rdquo; He was watching her with jealous eyes,
and she turned her head sharply and looked up at him.</p>
<p>Just for a moment a traitorous eagerness crossed her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
face; he could almost see the quick question on her lips,
then she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really! How funny! But, of course, as you say, you
must know a great many people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have known the Ashtons for years. You will like
Mrs. Ashton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sort of quiet insinuation in the words, and
Esther bit her lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;the son?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I think you said you
knew the son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know him&ndash;&ndash;he is in Paris, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky was conscious of a queer tightening about his
throat; it was a tremendous effort to force himself to
speak lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall I like him as well, do you think?&rdquo; Esther
asked deliberately.</p>
<p>Micky did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like him?&rdquo; she persisted.</p>
<p>Micky&rsquo;s restraint broke its bonds; if he had died for it
he could not have checked the words that rushed to his
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I detest the fellow!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a beastly outsider!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dared not look at her. He held his breath, waiting
for the storm to break, but if he had lost his self-control
she kept hers admirably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; she said. Her voice was a little breathless,
but quite calm. &ldquo;What does a man mean when he calls
another man&ndash;&ndash;such a name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face was quite colourless, even to the lips, and her
hands were clenched in the shabbiness of the cheap little
muff she carried.</p>
<p>He blunderingly tried to make amends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought not to have said that, just because he&rsquo;s not the
sort of man I care about,&rdquo; he said stammeringly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
quite all right&ndash;&ndash;it all depends from what point of view
you regard him. I hope you will forget that I said that,
Miss Shepstone. It&ndash;&ndash;it was unpardonable.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of complete indifference to me what you
say about&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Ashton,&rdquo; she told him.</p>
<p>She stopped. They had been walking along together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way are you going?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Micky flushed up to his eyes; he knew this was a dismissal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was coming along to see June,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hoped
you would allow me to walk along with you&ndash;&ndash;if I am not
intruding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther forced a smile, but her lips felt stiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I am not going back,&rdquo; she said. Her voice
sounded as if it were cut in ice. &ldquo;So I won&rsquo;t detain you.
Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and left him, walking quickly away again
in the direction from which she had just come.</p>
<p>Her eyes were smarting with tears that had to be restrained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare he&ndash;&ndash;oh, how dare he?&rdquo; she asked herself
passionately. &ldquo;What does he know about Raymond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not trust herself to go back home. She
walked about in the cold till she was tired out. She
wanted to be sure that Micky would have left Elphinstone
Road before she got there. She wondered if June
knew the Ashtons too. She probably did, as Micky Mellowes
knew them. They were both of Raymond&rsquo;s own
world, these two. It was only she, who loved him best,
who was outside the magic circle of his friends.</p>
<p>It was nearly supper time when she got in. She paused
for a moment in the hall and looked anxiously at the
rows of coats and hats hanging there. She thought she
would know Micky&rsquo;s if she saw them there. She forgot
that he might have taken them up to June&rsquo;s room. She
turned away with a little sigh.</p>
<p>At the foot of the stairs she met young Harley. He
coloured sensitively when he saw her and stood aside
for her to pass.</p>
<p>Esther flushed too. She wondered what he thought of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
her note refusing the theatre. With sudden impulse she
spoke&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are not angry with me, Mr. Harley, but&ndash;&ndash;but
perhaps you do not know that I am engaged to be
married, and so ... so I don&rsquo;t think I should accept
invitations from any one else, though&ndash;&ndash;though it was kind
of you to ask me,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have been delighted if you could have come,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;But, of course, if your fianc&eacute; would not care
about it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He broke off as if there was nothing more
to be said.</p>
<p>Esther wondered if Raymond really would mind; at
first he had been very jealous, and could not bear her
to speak to another man, but latterly&ndash;&ndash;she hated it, because
she could not forget that once he had told her she
could marry a man with money if she only played her
cards carefully&ndash;&ndash;the man who had said that seemed a
different personality altogether from the man whose letters
she had only lived for during the last fortnight.</p>
<p>Was she mean and unforgiving that she continually
found herself remembering the quarrels and scenes they
had had? She wanted so earnestly to forget them; she
went up to June&rsquo;s room with dragging steps.</p>
<p>The door of the room opened before she reached the
landing, and June came out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it was you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Poor soul! how tired
you sound. Another day of miserable failure, I suppose.
Never mind, come and sit down in the warm, and you&rsquo;ll
soon forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther laughed rather shamefacedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a day of success, strange to relate,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m tired, dead tired&ndash;&ndash;I must have walked miles.&rdquo;
She suddenly remembered Micky; she looked round with&ndash;&ndash;a
quick suspicion. &ldquo;Have you been alone all the afternoon?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, quite alone,&rdquo; June laughed. &ldquo;Who did you expect
to find here, pray?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody&ndash;&ndash;I only wondered if you had had any visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have known it wasn&rsquo;t the truth that he was
coming here,&rdquo; she told herself vexedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and what about the success?&rdquo; June asked; she
was sitting on the hearthrug stroking Charlie. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t mean to say that the old dear at the agency really
had something to offer you this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and she&rsquo;s desperately anxious for me to take it,
too. It&rsquo;s quite a good offer, but it means leaving here
and living in; and I don&rsquo;t believe I want to leave here,&rdquo;
she added ruefully.</p>
<p>June looked dismayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t let you go,&rdquo; she said promptly. &ldquo;Just as we
are settling down so cosily.&rdquo; She put her white hands
over her ears. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to hear another thing
about it, if that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t listen&ndash;&ndash;write
and refuse it&ndash;&ndash;write and refuse it at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther laughed; she pulled June&rsquo;s hands down and
held them firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you know any people named
Ashton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was longing to find out if June did know them;
it seemed such a lifetime since she had seen Raymond
or spoken to him, she was hungry to hear him spoken
of, even if only by this woman who probably had merely
known him as an ordinary acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ashton!&rdquo; June wrinkled up her nose. &ldquo;I know some
Ashtons who live in Brayanstone Square,&rdquo; she said at
last. &ldquo;A mother and son. A very handsome woman
she is, with white hair, she has a sort of grande dame
look about her&ndash;&ndash;the sort of woman you can imagine in
a powdered wig and a crinoline, curtsying to the queen.&rdquo;
She scrambled up, and, snatching a paper fan from the
shelf, swept Esther a graceful curtsy to illustrate her
meaning.</p>
<p>But Esther was too much in earnest to be amused.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It must be the same Mrs. Ashton,&rdquo; she said eagerly.
&ldquo;This is her card&ndash;&ndash;she gave it to me to-day&ndash;&ndash;Mrs. Raymond
Ashton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June glanced at the card and nodded briskly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s the same. I don&rsquo;t know her frightfully well;
she&rsquo;s rather reserved, too; but I admire her immensely&ndash;&ndash;well,
go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants me to go to her as a sort of companion&ndash;&ndash;she
has offered me fifty pounds a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad, is it? But you&rsquo;ll refuse, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked her to let me think it over; I said I should
like to talk it over with you first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June clasped her hands round her knees and stared
into the fire thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a widow, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Esther said hesitatingly.
&ldquo;At least&ndash;&ndash;she didn&rsquo;t say anything about a husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s a widow right enough,&rdquo; June said. &ldquo;And
delighted to be, I should think,&rdquo; she added bluntly. &ldquo;I
never knew the departed spouse, but from all accounts he
was a perfect terror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther said nothing. Raymond had always spoken of
his father as being a &ldquo;rare old sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a moment&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a son, too,&rdquo; June said. &ldquo;A kind of Adonis to
look at, beautiful eyes and all that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Esther. She tried hard to keep the eagerness
from her voice. &ldquo;Do you&ndash;&ndash;do you know the son
too?&rdquo; she asked nervously.</p>
<p>June gave a queer little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I know him. That is to say, I say &lsquo;How
d&rsquo;ye do&rsquo; to him when I have the misfortune to meet him,
but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther&rsquo;s hands were clasped in her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;why&ndash;&ndash;misfortune?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>June Mason shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s hard to explain&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s never
done me any harm, but there are some people one hates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
by instinct, and Raymond Ashton is one of the people
I hate.&rdquo; She smoothed a crease in the skirt of her frock.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a&ndash;&ndash;such an awful outsider,&rdquo; she added, unconsciously
choosing the word Micky Mellowes had used
a few hours before.</p>
<p>Esther sat very still. Twice she tried to speak, but
no words would come. She knew that it was unfair
to June to sit there and allow her to go on talking about
Raymond, but something in her heart seemed to have
set a seal on her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s that insufferable kind of creature who thinks
himself irresistible,&rdquo; June went on. &ldquo;Micky has often
told me the way he brags about his so-called &lsquo;conquests.&rsquo;
Conquests, indeed! What are they but a few poor ignorant
girls hoodwinked by his handsome face and
smooth tongue? Dozens of girls he&rsquo;s had, my dear, literally
dozens! Only the other day some one told me
that Mrs. Ashton had to threaten to cut him off with a
shilling if he didn&rsquo;t give up some little person he was
supposed to be going to marry! I don&rsquo;t know how true
it is, mind you, but that&rsquo;s the sort of man he is&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve no
time for him at all,&rdquo; she finished vigorously.</p>
<p>She turned to look at Esther, and gave a little exclamation
of alarm. &ldquo;How pale you are! Don&rsquo;t you feel
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite all right&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m just tired&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll
go down to supper to-night. I&rsquo;ll just stay here and be
quiet. I wanted to hear what you had to say about my
future employer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Future fiddlesticks!&rdquo; June retorted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going
to her, my dear; I shan&rsquo;t let you. If Raymond came
home while you were there, you&rsquo;d never have any peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther was lying back now with closed eyes. Over and
over again in her mind she was saying to herself&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it; it&rsquo;s all
cruel lies&ndash;&ndash;first Mr. Mellowes and now June. They both
hate him, that&rsquo;s what it is; but I don&rsquo;t believe a word
of what they say.&rdquo; June was bustling about the room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
fetching cushions and a light rug which she had laid over
Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a little sleep, and you&rsquo;ll feel heaps better,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>She went away, shutting the door quietly; and Esther
hid her face in her hands.</p>
<p>She hardly knew why she was crying, she only knew
that she was utterly miserable.</p>
<p>She took Ashton&rsquo;s last letter from her dress and read it
through again&ndash;&ndash;how could any one, reading it, doubt that
he loved her? How could any one, knowing his careful
thought for her, believe that he was the detestable personality
June and Micky had described?</p>
<p>She kissed the signature passionately. Nobody in all
the world counted but this one man.</p>
<p>She got up and went over to June&rsquo;s desk, which both
girls used; she felt that she must write to him and tell
him how much she wanted him.</p>
<p>When she had finished writing she looked to the head
of the paper on which she had written for the address,
and then she saw a postscript scribbled in a corner which
she had not noticed before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t write to me here&ndash;&ndash;I shall have left this hotel by the
time you get my letter. I will write again as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was like a door with iron bars being closed in her
face; she could not write after all! She could have no
relief for all her longing and unhappiness; she must just
wait and wait, eating her very soul out, till he wrote
again.</p>
<p>She tore up what she had written and threw it into the
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The phantom lover&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;June&rsquo;s half playful, half mocking
words came back to her with foreboding. Was he indeed
only a phantom lover? Just a creation of her own
brain and desire? She tried to thrust the thought from
her; she was tired and fanciful; in the morning she would
be all right; it was not fair to him, it was not fair to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
herself to be so doubting. She went back to June&rsquo;s
couch and curled up amongst the mauve pillows; life was
so hard, so disappointing; it gave so little of all that one
desired; the tears fell again, presently she cried herself
to sleep.</p>
<p>June came back on tiptoe; she stole across the room
and looked at Esther, then she went back to the hearthrug
to keep Charlie company.</p>
<p>The fire had died down and she replenished it as quietly
as she could, putting a knob on at a time with her
fingers.</p>
<p>As she leaned over to poke them softly together she
caught sight of a scrap of paper lying in the grate. It
looked like part of a torn letter, and without thinking
June picked it up&ndash;&ndash;the one word &ldquo;dearest&rdquo; stared up at
her in Esther&rsquo;s writing.</p>
<p>June looked at it for a long moment, then she turned
her head and glanced at Esther, still sleeping.</p>
<p>June frowned; she hunched her shoulders impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More phantom lover, I suppose,&rdquo; she told herself
crossly; she threw the little scrap of paper into the fire
and watched it burn with a sort of vixenish delight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to accept Mrs. Ashton&rsquo;s offer,&rdquo; said
Esther suddenly.</p>
<p>It was the following afternoon, and she had
been helping June paste labels on to the little mauve pots.
She looked up as she spoke, with the paste brush still in
her hand and her fingers all sticky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what I said?&rdquo; she demanded guiltily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard,&rdquo; June said rather tartly. &ldquo;And I think
you&rsquo;re a mean pig. However, go on! Have your own
way! Don&rsquo;t mind me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that at all,&rdquo; Esther declared. &ldquo;But I must
do something&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve been idle quite long enough. I shall
be sorry to leave you, but I shall still pay for my half
of the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you&ndash;&ndash;thank you very much,&rdquo; said June drily.
Esther flushed in distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so unkind! It&rsquo;s not that I want to leave
you. I&rsquo;ve been happier here with you than anywhere
else, but I must work, I can&rsquo;t live on nothing....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could live on three pounds a week if you wished
to. What do you suppose the phantom lover will say
if he knows that his money hasn&rsquo;t helped you, and that
you&rsquo;re going to make a drudge of yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be a drudge&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>June broke in impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t want to argue, but I think
it&rsquo;s mean of you. If you really liked me you&rsquo;d stay....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall come to see you whenever I get any time off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, once a week for two hours, I suppose&ndash;&ndash;and when
I shall probably be out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall write first and let you know when I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>June took no notice; she screwed the lid on to a perfume
bottle and wiped her fingers on the white overall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t put any more labels on,&rdquo; she said shortly.
&ldquo;I can do the rest myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took the tray away from Esther and carried it into
her bedroom; when she came back there was a suspicion
of tears in her eyes. Esther looked distressed. She felt
that she was behaving meanly, and yet she meant to
go to Mrs. Ashton&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky Mellowes is coming directly,&rdquo; June said tartly.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t want to see him you&rsquo;d better go. I know
you hate him....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther turned scarlet. She took off the apron she
had borrowed from June and turned to the door.</p>
<p>Before she reached it June followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a pig. I apologise humbly! Please stay. Why
don&rsquo;t you box my ears when I speak to you like this?&rdquo;
She dragged Esther back to the fire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wild because
you&rsquo;ve made up your mind to leave me. Our friendship
doesn&rsquo;t mean anything to you.... There&rsquo;s Micky&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;ll
want to know why I&rsquo;ve been crying. Amuse him
for five minutes, there&rsquo;s an angel, and I&rsquo;ll come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was gone in a flash.</p>
<p>A smiling Lydia showed Micky into the room. Lydia
liked Micky; he was always courteous, and he had been
generous with his tips on each occasion that he had visited
the house.</p>
<p>Micky looked a little embarrassed when he saw Esther.
He glanced quickly round the room. &ldquo;June ... I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming in a moment,&rdquo; Esther explained. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
you sit down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky sat on the arm of the big chair; he was cold;
he leaned forward, rubbing his hands vigorously. Esther
watched him critically.</p>
<p>She had told June that she did not consider him in
the least good-looking, but now the thought crossed her
mind that this had not been quite a fair thing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>He was tall and well made, and he had brown hair
that grew well about his temples, and waved slightly
where it parted.</p>
<p>His nose was nothing particular and slightly crooked,
and his eyes were nondescript in colour, but kind ... so
kind! Esther remembered it was the first thing she had
noticed about him the night they met.</p>
<p>He looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have you found another berth yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Mrs. Ashton&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Esther said.</p>
<p>She was amazed at the sudden change in his face; a
look of furious anger flashed into his eyes; he rose to
his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not serious?&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>Esther laughed; she felt painfully nervous without
knowing why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serious? Indeed I am!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Mr. Mellowes,
what are you doing?...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky had caught her hands. Jealousy was driving
him with whips of fire&ndash;&ndash;jealousy of this phantom lover,
whom he himself had created.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to go,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t
bear to think of you having to work for your living.
There&rsquo;s no need&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s all nonsense. You&rsquo;d hate being at
the Ashtons.... Esther&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wrenched herself free; she was white to the lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be mad!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How dare you speak
like this? What is it to you what I do? How dare you
try to interfere? What business is it of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky laughed shakily; he had recovered himself a little
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s everything to me,&rdquo; he said rather hoarsely. &ldquo;You
must know that it is. Esther, will you marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If only premeditated proposals were made, there would
be few marriages in the world. Ten minutes ago, when
Micky Mellowes walked into the room, he had no intention
of asking Esther to marry him, but now it seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
as if he had come for that express purpose as he stood
there, grimly obstinate.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence; then Esther drew
herself up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you must be mad,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only seen
you once or twice in my life. I have told you that I
am already engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but it makes no difference,&rdquo; said Micky.
&ldquo;I ask you to marry me&ndash;&ndash;will you marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew back from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said that two or three times
already, but I assure you that I&rsquo;m quite sane. I loved
you the first moment I ever saw you, but, of course, you
won&rsquo;t believe it. However, that doesn&rsquo;t matter&ndash;&ndash;you
haven&rsquo;t answered my question. Will you marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I am engaged&ndash;&ndash;how dare you?...&rdquo;
She backed away from him till she was close to the door.
Micky laughed savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m not going to hurt you&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m
not going to move from this hearthrug, but I should
like you to answer my question. Once again, will you
marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He forgot his promise and took a step towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can make you happier than any other man possibly
could. I&rsquo;ve never cared for a woman in my life till I met
you....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t marry you if you were the only man in
the world&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t even like you....&rdquo; Her voice
shook with anger now. &ldquo;My answer is no&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;no! I
shall never change my mind if I live to be a hundred
...&rdquo; she added vehemently. The words seemed
forced from her by something in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will,&rdquo; said Micky calmly, though he felt anything
but calm. &ldquo;Women always do; but if you don&rsquo;t feel like
changing it just at this moment, will you please tell June
I am here? I came to see her, and I&rsquo;m tired of waiting....&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
He turned away and went back to his seat on
the arm of the big chair as if nothing had happened, but
his hand shook when he tried to light a cigarette.</p>
<p>When June came back he was absently turning the
pages of a magazine; she looked at him for a moment,
then began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky! What in the world has happened to you lately?
Do you always read a paper upside down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky started, looked down at the magazine, and said a
bad word; then he laughed too, and flinging the magazine
across the room got to his feet, stretching his long arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Esther?&rdquo; June demanded. &ldquo;I asked her to
stay and amuse you till I came back....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did her best,&rdquo; said Micky drily. &ldquo;But I am
afraid I bored her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June looked annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think you two might try and like one another, if
only for my sake,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so perfectly obvious
that you hate one another, and I cannot see why for the
life of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of your instinctive hates, perhaps,&rdquo; Micky submitted,
with a touch of irony. He went back to the
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Shepstone tells me she has found a berth,&rdquo; he
said, after a moment. June nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Did she tell you with whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; Mrs. Ashton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the tone of his voice made June look up
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Micky shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&ndash;&ndash;I dared to suggest that perhaps she would
not like the place, and she flew at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like Esther; she asks for your advice, and
then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t ask for mine,&rdquo; Micky cut in. &ldquo;I very kindly
volunteered the information.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; June was on her knees now toasting buns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re stale,&rdquo; she informed Micky candidly. &ldquo;But
you won&rsquo;t know it when they&rsquo;re toasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky watched in silence. He was wondering if June
had heard anything of his conversation with Esther; they
had both spoken rather loudly. He was also wondering
whether he should tell June the whole story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must make allowances for her,&rdquo; June said briskly,
as he was still hesitating. &ldquo;I know she&rsquo;s worried about
this man. I discovered another thing this morning,
Micky&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she turned with a sudden jerk to look at him,
and the bun fell off the fork into the fire.</p>
<p>Micky laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what have you discovered now?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that she can&rsquo;t write to him&ndash;&ndash;he doesn&rsquo;t give
her an address&ndash;&ndash;or, if he does, he takes good care to
move on before she has time to answer his letters. It
looks to me, Micky, as if that young man is shirking
his responsibilities. If you ask my candid opinion, Esther
won&rsquo;t ever see him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky said &ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; rather uncomfortably. &ldquo;If the fellow
is travelling&ndash;&ndash;moving about....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could give her an address and have the letters
sent on, couldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; June demanded.</p>
<p>Micky rubbed his chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s she want to write to him for?&rdquo; he asked presently.</p>
<p>June swung round, and a second bun almost shared
the fate of the first, but she grabbed it back in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does she want to write to him for?&rdquo; she echoed
with scorn. &ldquo;My poor child, what does any one want to
write to any one for? She&rsquo;s in love with the man, and
when you&rsquo;re in love you simply have to write it down&ndash;&ndash;at
least, that&rsquo;s what I understand from people with wide
experience. Esther&rsquo;s bursting to write and tell the phantom
lover how much she loves him and what a wonderful
man he is; as a matter of fact she does write to him,
and tears the letters up again, and that&rsquo;s no satisfaction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
I wish to goodness he&rsquo;d get run over and done with,&rdquo; she
added exasperatedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose she wishes it,&rdquo; said Micky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because she doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s good for her;
he was probably the first man who had ever paid her any
attention, and from what she says he&rsquo;s a bit of a swell,
and I suppose she was flattered....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rot!&rdquo; said Micky violently; it made him boil to hear
June say things like this. Ashton superior to Esther? It
was like the man&rsquo;s confounded impudence to even think
such a thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not such rot,&rdquo; June said wisely. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what all
the trouble is about, or my name&rsquo;s not what it is. He
has a stuck-up old cat of a mother who won&rsquo;t condescend
to know Esther.... What did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Micky. He got up and began strolling
about the room with his hands in his pockets, and June
finished toasting her buns and made the tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just go up and tell Esther,&rdquo; she said. She went
out of the room and upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea,&rdquo; she announced cheerfully, knocking at Esther&rsquo;s
door; she turned the handle and went in. Esther was
standing by the window looking out into the neglected
garden at the back of the house; she turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really hungry, and if you&rsquo;d like to have Mr.
Mellowes to yourself&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>June stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said then drily, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;d wanted to have
Mr. Mellowes to myself I should have married him long
ago; so don&rsquo;t pretend you&rsquo;re not dying for one of the
stale but toasted buns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She linked her arm in Esther&rsquo;s, and they went downstairs
together. Esther did not want to come, but it
seemed easier to give way than to make excuses. She
took the chair which Micky brought forward; she felt a
little nervous and ill at ease. Once, when their eyes
met, she found herself colouring sensitively.</p>
<p>Micky let her alone in a marked fashion and talked to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
June. He had found the man he had been looking for
for months, he declared, a good business man, honest&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really honest, Micky?&rdquo; June asked, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really honest,&rdquo; Micky maintained. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d
put you on to him else? I&rsquo;ve told him all about you. I
went out to lunch with him yesterday and we talked face
creams and vanities till my head reeled. He&rsquo;s full of
ideas, bursting with fresh notions for advertising. He
didn&rsquo;t say so in actual words, but he thinks you&rsquo;ll be a
little gold mine if you&rsquo;ll put yourself in his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June&rsquo;s eyes sparkled; she jumped up from her chair,
put her arms around Micky&rsquo;s neck, and gave him a sounding
kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I just love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther glanced up quickly. June need not have done
that, she thought with a touch of irritation, but Micky
only laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here and you shall have that back with compound
interest,&rdquo; he said, but June shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough for to-day, and Esther&rsquo;s looking
shocked to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not&ndash;&ndash;I never thought about it,&rdquo; Esther protested
indignantly. June laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you looked angry anyway,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she, Micky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t notice,&rdquo; he answered coolly, but he
had, and for a moment his pulses had leapt at sight of
the anger in Esther&rsquo;s eyes; she could not surely hate
him as much as she pretended if it annoyed her that
June should kiss him.</p>
<p>But she was indifferent enough now at all events; she
was leaning back listlessly, her eyes fixed on the flames,
her face sad and thoughtful.</p>
<p>She was thinking about Ashton, Micky told himself
savagely, wishing he were here, no doubt&ndash;&ndash;Ashton, who
even at that moment was probably running round Paris
with Tubby Clare&rsquo;s little widow.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>June was packing the tea things on to the tray and
humming a snatch of song. Esther rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me do that&ndash;&ndash;you cleared away yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took the tray.</p>
<p>June asked Micky for a cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got heaps somewhere,&rdquo; she said vaguely. &ldquo;But
I never know where they are.&rdquo; She looked over to Esther.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother to put the cups away now,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Come back and be cosy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was rather surprised that Esther obeyed; she had
quite expected her to go off and not return.</p>
<p>Fond as she was of Esther, she could not quite make
her out; she was full of surprises. It was getting dusk,
and the room was full of shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I light up?&rdquo; Micky asked. &ldquo;Or do we like the
firelight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We like the firelight,&rdquo; June said promptly; she nestled
down amongst her mauve cushions.</p>
<p>Micky was sitting straddle-ways across a chair between
the two girls, and Esther had drawn back a little so that
her face was in shadow. Micky glanced at her once, but
could only see the glint of firelight on her hair and her
hands clasped listlessly in the lap of her frock. He
glanced at them; she still wore Ashton&rsquo;s ring, with its
three inferior stones; he wondered how long the farce
was going to be kept up and what would happen to bring
it to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If some one doesn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; June said drowsily, &ldquo;I
shall go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a quiet peacefulness in the cosy little room.
Micky crossed his arms on the chair back and leaned
his chin on them, staring into the fire, and Esther, from
her place in the shadows, looked at him unobserved.</p>
<p>Not in the least good-looking, she told herself again,
and yet in common fairness she had to admit to herself
that there was something about Micky Mellowes that was
undeniably attractive.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>She liked the obstinacy of his chin&ndash;&ndash;she liked the way
his hair grew, and the shape of his hands&ndash;&ndash;strong, manly
hands they were, in spite of the fact that they had probably
never done a day&rsquo;s useful work in their lives. Of
course he was too well dressed. To begin with, there
was no need to wear grey spats over his shoes, or to have
his trousers so immaculately creased. She forgot that
she had liked Ashton to indulge in both these weaknesses.</p>
<p>Micky was whistling a snatch of a love-song under his
breath. Esther did not know what it was; she had never
heard the melody before, but something in the softly
sentimental notes brought the tears to her eyes; before
she was aware of it they were tumbling down fast.</p>
<p>June sprang suddenly to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are we all mooning like this? Micky, give me
a match.&rdquo; She almost snatched the box from him and
lit the gas; the yellow flare flooded the room. Micky,
glancing at Esther, saw the tears on her cheeks and the
way she averted her head.</p>
<p>He scowled and rose to his feet, standing so that his
tall figure shielded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must be getting along,&rdquo; he said. He pulled
out his watch and looked at it, but he never noticed what
the time was.</p>
<p>He was thinking of Esther and the tears he had surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when are you going to introduce me to this man
who is to make my fortune?&rdquo; June demanded crisply.
She was standing on a footstool, trying to see herself in
a glass above the mantelshelf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther, you might have told me what a sight I look!
My hair is all over the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it looked nice,&rdquo; Esther said hurriedly. She
knew Micky had seen her tears, and was silently hating
him for it.</p>
<p>Micky answered hesitatingly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll
fix it up and let you know. There&rsquo;s no hurry, is there?
I don&rsquo;t want him to think we are too keen.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But I am keen,&rdquo; June insisted. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you be
keen if some one had told you you would be a gold mine,
properly handled?&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Oh, I forgot! money
is no object to you. Well, bide your own time, my dear,
but don&rsquo;t let it be too long.... Must you really
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so; and, June&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo; said June, intent on another cigarette.</p>
<p>Micky fidgeted. He looked down at the carpet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t hear anything of me for a few days
you&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;m out of London....&rdquo; He looked at
Esther, but she was kneeling down by the fire stroking
Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of London!&rdquo; June said in surprise. &ldquo;Where are
you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky cleared his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of running over to Paris for a day or two,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paris!&rdquo; They were both looking at him now. Micky
was painfully aware of the eagerness in Esther&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I haven&rsquo;t been since September. Anything I
can do for you while I&rsquo;m there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>June raised her brows comically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for me, but perhaps Esther ... Esther has
a great friend over there, haven&rsquo;t you, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther turned crimson from chin to brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mellowes is not at all likely to meet any friend
of mine,&rdquo; she said stiffly.</p>
<p>Micky felt horribly sorry for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure, Miss Shepstone,&rdquo; he said lightly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small world, you know, and it&rsquo;s the most unexpected
things that happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Esther seemed not to have heard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Micky went to Paris. &ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t want you,
Driver,&rdquo; he told his man awkwardly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only
going for a day or two. I&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;I shan&rsquo;t want
you,&rdquo; he said again lamely.</p>
<p>He looked at the man guiltily, but Driver was as impassive
as ever. &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; he said. He could
not understand what had happened to Micky; as a rule,
he refused even to take his own railway ticket or speak
to a porter. This new independence worried him.</p>
<p>But Micky went off cheerfully enough. He rang June
up at her club the morning he started and told her he
was really going. He heard her cheery laugh across the
telephone. &ldquo;Micky, you&rsquo;re not up to any mischief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I should be!&rdquo; he answered with dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t trust you,&rdquo; she said promptly. &ldquo;However,
have a good time, and if you see the phantom lover, you
might push him into the Seine for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember,&rdquo; Micky said grimly. He hesitated.
&ldquo;Everything all right?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She echoed his words, not understanding. &ldquo;Everything
all right? Do you mean the swindle? Oh, yes, it&rsquo;s going
fine, thank you. I had another order from those American
export people this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.... And&ndash;&ndash;Miss Shepstone gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s going on Saturday. Sickening, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll stay long,&rdquo; Micky said soothingly.
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do her any harm to see how she likes it. Well,
good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood for a moment after he had hung up the receiver,
staring at it. He wished he had not arranged
to go to Paris. Supposing Ashton took it into his head
to come back while he was away? Supposing he went
home and found Esther there?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>He tried to believe that it was not at all likely, but at
the last moment, as he got into the train and received
his ticket from the solemn Driver, Micky said&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know where to find me if anything happens&ndash;&ndash;if
anything should be the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Driver raised wooden eyes to his master&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;Was you expecting anything to happen, sir?&rdquo;
he asked stolidly.</p>
<p>Micky got red. &ldquo;No, you fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; Driver retorted unmoved.</p>
<p>And so Micky went to Paris. It was dark when he
got there, and he drove at once to a small and unpretentious
hotel in a narrow side street, where he had never
been before, but of which he had heard from Philips.</p>
<p>After all, it was only for a few nights. He did not
want to stay in Paris long&ndash;&ndash;Paris always bored him, but
he made a little grimace as he looked up at the windows
of the hotel. It certainly was a rotten-looking little
show, he thought as he followed the concierge into the
hall. This, too, was small and unpretentious, with a polished
floor and wicker chairs scattered about. There
was a kind of winter garden leading from the lounge,
where a few neglected palms and ferns were struggling
for an existence, and the whole place was silent, almost
deserted.</p>
<p>Micky was too late for dinner, but a smiling host,
with a short dark beard, assured him that he could have
a most excellent supper in less time than he would enumerate
of what that supper would consist. Micky said
he didn&rsquo;t care what it was. He followed his suit-case
up the wide, shallow stairs to a quaint little room with
a low ceiling and polished floor.</p>
<p>He was beginning to feel more at home after all; one
could be quiet here and not be eternally running up
against people whom one knew; he felt more cheerful
when he went down to his supper.</p>
<p>He asked the waiter if there were many people staying
there. His tone of voice sounded as if he sincerely hoped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
there were not, and the waiter tactfully submitted that
the place was almost empty.</p>
<p>Micky proceeded with his supper.</p>
<p>It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock, but he went out into the
lounge when he had finished and sat down at a table in
one of the most secluded corners.</p>
<p>There were pen and ink and a supply of hotel note
paper, which Micky looked at with great satisfaction,
before he took up a pen, carefully examined the nib,
squared his elbows and began to write.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My darling&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Micky wrote the words hurriedly and covered them
over with a sheet of blotting paper as if they made him
feel guilty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I should have been leaving Paris before now, but
have been delayed. I shall be staying here till the end of the
week and am writing this so that you can let me have a letter
before I leave. I hope you have received both my other letters
safely, and are quite well and as happy as possible, seeing that
we cannot be together&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He sat back for a moment and looked at this frowningly,
then he wrote on hurriedly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to miss me, you see&ndash;&ndash;I want you to feel as I do,
that there is only one thing to look forward to and that is when
we shall be together again. Dearest, it seems now that I have
never really told you how well I love you. Some day, if all
that I wish for comes true, I will tell you the many things you
would not let me say when we were last together....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Micky&rsquo;s pen flew easily enough. For the moment he
had forgotten why and for whom he was writing, and
thought only of Esther as she had looked when he last
saw her with the tears wet on her cheeks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Write to me as soon as you get this, so that I may have
a letter to take with me when I leave. I shall watch for every
post and count the minutes till it comes. I have arranged with
my bankers to send the money to you every week. Dearest, if
this is not enough, please let me know, and I will send some
more....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></div>
<p>Micky scratched out the last five words, finally rewriting
the whole page to add</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;... Let me know and we must see what can be done.
I cannot bear to think that you are wanting anything which it is
in my power to give you. Tell me all about yourself; if you
are well and happy&ndash;&ndash;and how often you think of me. I shall
write again soon, perhaps to-morrow ... and till then, and
for ever, I am always yours, Micky ....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He added his own signature without noticing it, then
realised what he had done and rewrote the last page in
a panic.</p>
<p>Supposing he had sent it!&ndash;&ndash;it made him hot all over
to think what would have happened. He would have to
be more careful, he told himself severely. He carefully
directed the letter and went out to post it, then he went
to bed in the little room with the low ceiling and lay
awake half the night.</p>
<p>Now the letter had gone he wished he had never sent
it; after all, it was cheating Esther. It was not fair to
make her write to him; he felt that he had behaved like
a cur ... he tossed and turned from side to side.
Perhaps she would not write! He almost hoped she
would not. When at last he dozed off it was almost
daybreak; when he woke it was eleven o&rsquo;clock and the
sunshine was pouring into his room.</p>
<p>He had a bit of a headache and felt wretched; he drank
four cups of strong coffee and went out.</p>
<p>He avoided the popular thoroughfares; he sauntered
about till lunch time and then went back to the hotel.
Apparently the waiter had spoken the truth when he said
the place was almost empty, for only two of the twenty
tables were occupied beside his own.</p>
<p>Micky felt bored; he made up his mind to tell Philips
what he thought of his recommendation when he got
back to London. He slept all the afternoon, then dressed
and went off to dinner at the hotel where he and Driver
stayed when they were last in Paris. Here at least was
a welcome; most of the waiters recognised him; the attention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
was excellent, and he got a decent dinner. The
hotel was full, but though Micky looked suspiciously at
every one who came in, he recognised nobody.</p>
<p>He wondered how long he had got to stay in Paris.
Esther could not get his letter and send a reply that
would arrive in less than three days; he calculated that
he could not get back to London before Sunday morning.</p>
<p>And Esther was going to Mrs. Ashton&rsquo;s on Saturday.</p>
<p>He had just finished his dinner when the swing doors
opened and a man came into the room with a lady in
evening dress.</p>
<p>Micky looked at them, and his heart began to race&ndash;&ndash;for
the man was Raymond Ashton, and the woman,
Tubby Clare&rsquo;s little widow.</p>
<p>Ashton saw Micky at once, and his face fell into almost
comical lines of dismay, but he pulled himself together
at once and spoke to the woman beside him.</p>
<p>Micky knew Mrs. Clare slightly; he rose and went
towards them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you were in Paris,&rdquo; he said. He shook hands
with Mrs. Clare; she was rather a pretty little woman,
small and plump, with round, meaningless eyes and a
friendly smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to the opera,&rdquo; Ashton said. &ldquo;Mrs. Clare
is not staying here, but she very kindly consented to come
and dine with me. Are you staying here, Micky? When
did you come over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night; and I&rsquo;m not staying here. Just dropped
in for some grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better dine with us,&rdquo; Ashton said, but he did
not sound very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Micky laughed. &ldquo;Thanks, but I have dined. I was
just leaving when you came in.&rdquo; He thought of Esther,
and his face hardened. This was the man of whom she
was thinking all day and every day; this man who was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
so obviously going to try and marry Tubby Clare&rsquo;s little
widow.</p>
<p>He stood talking to them for a few moments, then excused
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me where you are staying,&rdquo; Ashton
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;and I&rsquo;m going away to-morrow anyway....
When are you coming back to town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashton looked quickly at his companion. &ldquo;Oh, not yet
awhile,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Micky met his eyes steadily. &ldquo;By the way,
I got your letter,&rdquo; he said after a moment. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t
ask about that letter you gave me. I posted it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raymond turned crimson. &ldquo;The letter&ndash;&ndash;oh yes, thanks&ndash;&ndash;thanks,
very much. You didn&rsquo;t take it then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I posted it.&rdquo; Micky&rsquo;s voice was flinty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er&ndash;&ndash;thanks awfully!&rdquo; Ashton said again. He twisted
his moustache nervously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you some other time,&rdquo;
he said with a rush. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop you a line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right oh!&rdquo; said Micky laconically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I shall see you again too, Mr. Mellowes,&rdquo; Mrs.
Clare said. She thought she was saying the right thing.
She thought these two men were friends, and she was
sufficiently in love with Raymond to wish to be liked by
his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Clare,&rdquo; Micky said stolidly. &ldquo;But I
am going back to London to-morrow; I am afraid I shall
have very little time, though I should be delighted, of
course&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt rather sorry for this woman. After all, she
was harmless and good natured, she deserved a better
fate than to be snapped up by a good-looking fortune-hunter.</p>
<p>He was getting into his coat in the lounge when Ashton
came after him. He looked worried and abashed; he
asked a hurried question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s all right, eh, Micky?&ndash;&ndash;Lallie, I mean&ndash;&ndash;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
thought from the way you looked just now&ndash;&ndash;she&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s
all right&ndash;&ndash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear chap&ndash;&ndash;how should I know? She never answered
my letter, though I sent the money, as you
wished. I thought you would have heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I didn&rsquo;t mean to write&ndash;&ndash;I said that I wanted
the whole affair cut out,&rdquo; Ashton said irritably.</p>
<p>Micky made no response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sure to be all right, anyway,&rdquo; Ashton said after a
moment. &ldquo;If she hadn&rsquo;t I should have heard&ndash;&ndash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky looked at him coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You rather sound as if you were expecting to hear
she&rsquo;d done something foolish&ndash;&ndash;jumped off Waterloo
Bridge or something&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he said drily.</p>
<p>Ashton laughed. &ldquo;Well, you never know,&rdquo; he said
heartlessly. &ldquo;Women are such queer creatures&ndash;&ndash;and
Lallie was so excitable; she said more than once that
she&rsquo;d do away with herself&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s all rot, of course, but
... what did you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Micky curtly. &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo; He
turned on his heel and went out.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XIV' id='CHAPTER_XIV'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>
<p>Micky stayed in Paris four days; the four longest
days of his life.</p>
<p>He wandered about killing time and wishing
everything and every one at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>It seemed impossible that he had ever managed to
have a good time over here&ndash;&ndash;the noise and bustle of the
streets got on his nerves; the things that had always
amused him before bored him and left him cold; he
thought of London with a deadly sort of home-sickness.</p>
<p>Esther did not mean to write to him, he was sure, and
in some ways he hoped she would not; he realised that
he was playing a mean trick on her, cheating her out of
fond words and a love-letter to which he had not the
smallest claim.</p>
<p>He tried to salve his conscience by making up his mind
to leave on the Monday morning whatever happened; if
there was no letter by that time there would never be
one. Esther would have gone to Mrs. Ashton&rsquo;s. It was
surprising how much he hated the thought of her being
with Raymond&rsquo;s mother. During the interminable hours
when he walked about Paris trying to kill time he thought
out all manner of possibilities that might result from this
unforeseen contingency. Mrs. Ashton might get fond of
Esther&ndash;&ndash;and if she got fond of Esther, well&ndash;&ndash;who knew
what might happen in the future in spite of Tubby
Clare&rsquo;s little widow? He had not run across Ashton
again, and he sincerely hoped that he would not.</p>
<p>When Monday morning came he packed his portmanteau
before he left his room&ndash;&ndash;there would be no letter
for him, so he might as well clear out and go home without
making a further fool of himself. There was not
the least hope in his heart when he went to the bureau
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
and asked for letters; the reply came as it had done each
morning: &ldquo;Nothing for monsieur....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky turned away. He was half way to the dining-room
before it suddenly dawned upon him that they did
not know he was expecting letters in the name of Ashton&ndash;&ndash;that
he had forgotten to tell them. He went back
hurriedly to the bureau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any letters for Ashton?&ndash;&ndash;I am expecting one for a
friend of mine of that name....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited breathlessly while the girl sorted through
the pigeon-holes on the wall; he felt as if he could hardly
breathe when she came back with a grey envelope in her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mais oui....&rdquo; she said smilingly. &ldquo;I did not
know it was for monsieur....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mickey almost snatched it from her; he had not even
glanced at the writing, but he knew it must be from
Esther. He sat down at the breakfast table with his
thoughts in a whirl; he was sure that the waiter must
know how excited he felt. He ordered coffee and rolls
before he opened the envelope; he laid it down on the
cloth beside him and stared at it very much as a sentimental
girl might stare at her first love-letter, hesitating
to open it, wishing to prolong the ultimate delight.</p>
<p>Finally he cut it open carefully and drew out the contents.
His pulses were racing, he did not know if shame
or delight were the greatest emotion in his heart; he
glanced at the first two words and the blood rushed to
his face.</p>
<p>It seemed almost sacrilege to read what she had written
to the man she loved&ndash;&ndash;he pushed the paper back into
its envelope&ndash;&ndash;he did not look at it again till he had
finished his pretence of a meal, then he took it out with
him into the rather dingy winter garden and sat down in
the quietest corner he could find.</p>
<p>There he faced the greatest moment of his life; as to
whether he should go on with this thing or wipe it out
of his life once and for all.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></div>
<p>Ashton had done with Esther; he was as sure of that
as he was sure that Ashton meant to marry Mrs. Clare.
This being so, was it wrong of him to try and give Esther
some happiness in place of what she had lost? She had
refused to marry him&ndash;&ndash;she had said that she could never
care for him; could he hope to make her change her
mind? In his heart he was sure that he could; he wanted
her so badly that it seemed to him as if the very force
of his desire must compel some return from her.</p>
<p>He sat staring down the dismal garden with moody
eyes. He knew it was a big risk; he thought of her as
he had first seen her and as he had last seen her. He
had never once really thought that she looked happy&ndash;&ndash;she
had never quite lost the shadow in her eyes or the
droop to her lips which he had at first noticed, and he
wanted her to be happy. He wanted her happiness far
more than he wanted his own.</p>
<p>He took the letter from his pocket and looked at the
address on the envelope. &ldquo;Raymond Ashton, Esq....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hated the sight of that name&ndash;&ndash;some day Esther
would hate it too, when she knew how he had deceived
her.</p>
<p>It was a great risk&ndash;&ndash;but ...</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll chance it,&rdquo; said Mickey under his breath, and
drew out the letter again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>My Darling Boy</span>,&ndash;&ndash;You can never know how glad and happy
I was to get your letter to-night and to know that I can really
write to you at last. I have been so miserable during these weeks
in spite of all your goodness&ndash;&ndash;and you have been good. It makes
me feel mean and ungrateful now when I remember how horrid
I often was to you before you went away. When you come back
I will make it all up to you, and show you how nice I really can
be, because I do love you&ndash;&ndash;I have never loved any one but you.
Thank you so much for the money you have sent me&ndash;&ndash;I was very
much down on my luck when it came. They haven&rsquo;t a vacancy
for me just now at Eldred&rsquo;s, or else they did not want me back,
and I am going to try and find another berth. I am living in a
new boarding-house, as you will see; it&rsquo;s ever so much nicer than
the Brixton Road, and I shall be able to stay on now you are so
generously sending me money. I have made a nice friend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
here, too, a girl named June Mason&ndash;&ndash;she tells me that she knows
your mother, and you, too!&ndash;&ndash;I did not let her know how well I
knew you, dear, as I thought perhaps you would rather I said
nothing about it. She has a man friend who sometimes comes to
see her&ndash;&ndash;a Mr. Mellowes&ndash;&ndash;she thinks the world of him, but I
think he is detestable....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mickey caught his breath hard. After a moment he
went on reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;June tells me he is very rich, and quite a &lsquo;somebody,&rsquo; but I
cannot see anything out of the ordinary about him, and he isn&rsquo;t a
bit good looking. He knows you, too&ndash;&ndash;but he does not say much
about you. Dearest, it seems such a long time since I saw you&ndash;&ndash;and
I cannot help wondering if you really miss me and want me
as much as I want you.... Sometimes I would give just
anything to lay my head on your shoulder and say how much I
love you. I&rsquo;m very lonely, really; though June is so kind she
isn&rsquo;t any one of my very own, is she? And now I wonder if you
will be very angry with me if I ask you something? I don&rsquo;t
think I should have dared to, only your last letters have been so
dear and kind. Raymond, why can&rsquo;t I come out to you and be
with you? We could get married, and we should be ever so happy
even if we have to be poor&ndash;&ndash;at least, I know I could, and from
your letters, somehow I think it sounds as if you, too, have realised
that there isn&rsquo;t much happiness away from me. I have had
the offer of a good post&ndash;&ndash;I won&rsquo;t tell you what it is, as I want
it to be a surprise to you if I do take it. But if you would like
me to come, I will just leave everything and come to you. Couldn&rsquo;t
you send me a wire when you get this letter? I shall be longing
and waiting to hear from you. I am a little bit afraid in my
heart, really, now I have written this, but your last letter is lying
beside me, and I keep peeping at it and reading what you say
there, and somehow I feel that it&rsquo;s going to be all right.&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='ralign'>With all my love for ever and ever, <span class='smcap'>Lallie</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mickey sat there staring down at her signature a long
time after he had reached the end.</p>
<p>Then he moved slowly as if it cost him an effort. He
was rather pale now, and there was a hard line round
his mouth. So that was how she thought of him! Somehow
he had not imagined how much it would hurt to
read the fond words and to know all the time that they
were written to another man. And to a man so unworthy!
He thought of Ashton as he had seen him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
three nights ago with Mrs. Clare; of his callous questioning
about Esther; of his almost brutal remarks, and
it made his blood boil.</p>
<p>He could picture her so well&ndash;&ndash;waiting for a wire that
would never come.</p>
<p>He hated Ashton at that moment. His brows almost
met above his eyes in a scowl as he went up to the bureau
and asked for his bill. The smiling French girl sobered
a little meeting his gaze; for once she did not dare to
smile or dimple; she gave him his account silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but they are funny, these English;&rdquo; she told her
father afterwards. &ldquo;To-day he had no smile, the tall
monsieur&ndash;&ndash;not even one little smile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She watched Micky across the lounge with interested
eyes as he sat down at one of the tables and proceeded to
write a letter. It took him a long time, and twice she
saw that he tore up what he had written and flung it
into the wastepaper basket, but at last he had finished,
and getting up, stalked away.</p>
<p>Celeste ventured out then&ndash;&ndash;there was nobody about,
and tiptoeing across the lounge, took the torn papers
from the paper-basket. They were torn across and
across, but on one or two slips the writing was visible,
and she carried them back with her to the shelter of the
bureau.</p>
<p>She spread them out on the desk before her, carefully
piecing them together. She knew English quite well,
and she soon made out one sentence:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not that I do not love you&ndash;&ndash;I have never loved
you better than at this moment&ndash;&ndash;but....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celeste was sentimental. She gave a big sigh of
sympathy for the big Englishman. &ldquo;No wonder he has
no smile!&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est si triste!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>
<p>It was raining and miserable when Micky arrived in
London. The roads were wet and slippery, and every
taxi and omnibus splashed pedestrians with mud.</p>
<p>Micky shivered as he stood waiting while a porter
lugged his traps down from the rack. He had felt
depressed in Paris, but now London seemed a thousand
times worse. The sight of Driver waiting on the platform
annoyed him. He answered the man&rsquo;s stolid greeting
snappishly. He had wanted to come home, and yet
now he was here he wished himself a thousand miles
away. He leaned back in a corner of the taxi and shut
his eyes.</p>
<p>The last four days had got on his nerves; Esther&rsquo;s
letter in his pocket was like an eternal reproach.</p>
<p>Why had he come back at all? She did not want
him&ndash;&ndash;nobody wanted him in the whole forsaken world.
The silence of his flat seemed a thing to be dreaded in
his present mood. Driver&rsquo;s inscrutable face would, he
felt, drive him mad. With sudden impulse he leaned
forward and called to the chauffeur, &ldquo;Stop&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve changed
my mind&ndash;&ndash;drive me back to the Savoy....&rdquo;</p>
<p>There would be life there, at any rate&ndash;&ndash;life and people
and music&ndash;&ndash;something to make a man forget the depression
that sat like a ton weight on his shoulders.</p>
<p>He felt utterly at a loose end; he stalked moodily into
the lounge. There were many people there, girls in pretty
dinner frocks, with their attendant cavaliers. Micky
glanced at none of them, till suddenly a girl who had
been sitting on a couch listening rather listlessly to the
conversation of a youth beside her, rose to her feet when
she saw Micky, the hot colour flying to her cheeks.</p>
<p>For a moment she hesitated, waiting for him to look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
at her, to speak&ndash;&ndash;but Micky had stalked by without turning
his eyes, and after the barest second she followed
and touched his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky....&rdquo; she said breathlessly, and again
&ldquo;Micky,&rdquo; with an odd little catch in her voice.</p>
<p>Micky turned as if he had been shot, then stopped
dead, colouring up to the roots of his hair, for the girl
was Marie Deland.</p>
<p>She smiled tremulously, reading the distress in his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I was never going to see you any more,&rdquo;
she said. She tried hard to speak casually, but her voice
quivered a little. &ldquo;Where have you been hiding all this
time, Micky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky stammered out that he really didn&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;that
he&rsquo;d only just come back from Paris&ndash;&ndash;that he did
call to see her one night, but that they told him she
wasn&rsquo;t in. She broke in there impetuously&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know; I&rsquo;m so sorry. It wasn&rsquo;t my fault. I was
there all the time. Mother&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She stopped, biting her
lip, but there was no need to explain further. Micky
could well imagine that it was by Mrs. Deland&rsquo;s orders
that the butler had said &ldquo;Not at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His heart was full of remorse as he looked down at
Marie. Such a little while ago he had thought of her
as his wife. He had fully meant to marry her.</p>
<p>He broke out again agitatedly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you must think I&rsquo;m an awful sweep. I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;oh,
I can&rsquo;t explain.&rdquo; He glanced past her to where the
rather vapid-looking youth to whom she had been speaking
sat tugging at an incipient moustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he asked again. &ldquo;Who
are you with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told him that she was with her married sister
and some friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have dinner here,&rdquo; she said. She
was longing to ask Micky to dine with them, but was
obviously afraid to do so.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></div>
<p>After a moment&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I ought to be going,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Violet
will wonder where I am, Micky.&rdquo; She looked up at him
with abashed eyes. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I suppose&ndash;&ndash;you wouldn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;will
you come out to tea with me to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky&rsquo;s face reflected the flush in her own; he looked
away in miserable embarrassment. He knew that she
felt the same towards him as she had done before that
memorable New Year&rsquo;s Eve, and he knew that whatever
happened now he could never feel the same to her any
more.</p>
<p>He answered that he would be pleased, very pleased.
Where should he meet her&ndash;&ndash;or should he call for her?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;You know where
we always used to go&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll be there at four, Micky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put out her hand and Micky was forced to take
it; he felt how her fingers shook in his, and he cursed
himself for a brute as he turned away and left her.</p>
<p>In a way he was glad they had met. Any other
woman would have given him the snubbing which he
knew he so richly deserved. Deep down in his heart he
wished that she had done so; anything would have been
easier to meet than this trembling overture of friendship.
He knew that the little abashed expression in Marie&rsquo;s
dark eyes could only mean one thing, that he had cut
her to the soul and that she still cared for him.</p>
<p>He left the Savoy without having any dinner; he
went back to his rooms, where the imperturbable Driver
was brushing and refolding his master&rsquo;s clothes. It had
almost broken Driver&rsquo;s heart to see the way in which
Micky had packed his things; he raised eyes of wooden
reproach as Micky entered the room.</p>
<p>There was a pile of letters on the table. Micky flicked
them through carelessly; nothing of interest&ndash;&ndash;a few bills
and a good many invitations; nothing from Esther&ndash;&ndash;not
even a note from June.</p>
<p>He sat down by the fire and proceeded to cut the
many envelopes open. He kept thinking of Marie and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
wondering if it would be kinder not to meet her to-morrow,
after all; if he could possibly write her a note that
would tactfully explain the situation.</p>
<p>He just glanced at each of the notes as he opened
them, and let them drop to the carpet at his feet. They
could be answered later; there was nothing of importance,
nothing he ... his attention was arrested:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Dear Mr. Mellowes</span>,&ndash;&ndash;I wonder if it will be asking too much
of you to come round and see me one afternoon for half an
hour?&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class='ralign'>Yours sincerely, <span class='smcap'>Laura Ashton</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Micky glanced quickly at the address at the top of
the paper&ndash;&ndash;it was from Raymond&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>What in the world could she want with him, he
wondered blankly. He looked across at Driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This note&ndash;&ndash;the one that came by hand&ndash;&ndash;when did
it come?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Driver replied that it had been there for two days.
He waited a moment, then went on brushing Micky&rsquo;s
coat.</p>
<p>Micky felt rather disturbed.</p>
<p>Raymond&rsquo;s mother! What in the wide world could
she want with him? Supposing it were anything to do
with Esther ...</p>
<p>He wrote a note in reply at once and said he would
call the following afternoon; he could just look in early
for half an hour and go on afterwards to meet Marie;
it was strange how he dreaded both these appointments.</p>
<p>He felt ridiculously nervous when he reached Mrs.
Ashton&rsquo;s house. For the first time it occurred to him
that possibly Esther would be here too.</p>
<p>He was kept waiting some minutes in the drawing
room&ndash;&ndash;minutes during which he wandered restlessly
about staring at the pictures and the photographs.</p>
<p>There were many portraits of Raymond&ndash;&ndash;Raymond
at all stages of his chequered career, smiling and handsome.
Micky turned his back on them with a feeling
of disgust.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></div>
<p>The door opened behind him, and, turning sharply,
he found himself face to face with Mrs. Ashton.</p>
<p>She came forward with outstretched hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is kind of you, Mr. Mellowes. I did not know
you had been away till I got your note this morning.
I was wondering why I had had no reply to mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky blurted out that he had been in Paris&ndash;&ndash;that he
only came back yesterday evening.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ashton&rsquo;s face changed a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paris! Have you been with that son of mine?&rdquo;
she asked sharply.</p>
<p>Micky coloured. &ldquo;I met him&ndash;&ndash;quite by chance, though.
We were not together more than a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled rather ironically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got tired of him at last, then?&rdquo; she asked.
She moved over to the fire. She looked back at Micky
quizzically. &ldquo;I have often wondered how you put up
with his friendship so long, Mr. Mellowes,&rdquo; she added
rather sadly.</p>
<p>Micky felt embarrassed. He had always liked Mrs.
Ashton. He stammered out that he and Raymond had
always been very good friends.</p>
<p>She drew her chair a little closer to the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well&ndash;&ndash;then, perhaps, you will be kind enough
to answer a question I am going to ask you. Mr. Mellowes,
what was the name of that girl at Eldred&rsquo;s whom
Raymond was always about with before Christmas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was so unexpected that Micky was utterly
taken aback. Before he was aware of it he had told a
lie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;at least, he always spoke of her as
&lsquo;Lallie.&rsquo; I never once saw him with her, Mrs. Ashton&ndash;&ndash;he
never introduced me to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked rather incredulous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you were such friends,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Micky coloured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our tastes were not always identical,&rdquo; he said rather
stiffly. &ldquo;I am not very interested in women, and he&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And he is,&rdquo; she finished for him. &ldquo;There is no need
to tell me that&ndash;&ndash;I know my son. So you cannot tell
me the name of this girl? I had hoped that you would
be able to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky met her eyes unflinchingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say I could find out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If she is
still at Eldred&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is not there.&rdquo; Mrs. Ashton looked up at Micky
with an anxious line between her handsome eyes. &ldquo;Mr.
Mellowes, I have always prided myself on my sense of
justice, and somehow lately I have got an uncomfortable
feeling that when I forbade Raymond to have anything
more to do with that girl it would have been better if
I had advised her to have nothing more to do with him.
He is my son, and perhaps it seems strange for me to
speak about him like that, but you cannot have been
friends with him all these months without finding him
out, so I need not apologise. Raymond is just his father
over again....&rdquo; She paused, and a painful little
smile curved her lips.</p>
<p>She looked at Micky rather pathetically. &ldquo;There is no
need for me to say any more, is there?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Micky did not answer. He had heard many stories
about Raymond&rsquo;s father, all more or less unsavoury, and
he knew that from all accounts Mrs. Ashton had been
greatly to be pitied during his lifetime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So if you can&rsquo;t help me in this,&rdquo; she went on
presently, &ldquo;I am afraid I have brought you here for
nothing. I want to find out who this girl is, and see
her for myself.&rdquo; She paused, but Micky&rsquo;s face was
inscrutable.</p>
<p>In his heart he was convinced that she did not believe
him, but he had no intention of telling her Esther&rsquo;s
name; he longed to know if Esther were in the house,
but, of course, it was impossible to ask.</p>
<p>It almost seemed as if Mrs. Ashton could read his
thoughts, for she said suddenly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Mr. Mellowes, that I am going to
have a companion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky echoed her last word vacantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Companion?&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;er....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a girl,&rdquo; Mrs. Ashton went on; &ldquo;I have always
envied people with daughters; a daughter is so much
more to a mother than a son; but as I was not fortunate
enough to have one of my own I am going to try having
a companion. Raymond will be annoyed, I dare say&ndash;&ndash;he
has always pooh-poohed the idea when I have mentioned
it to him, but now&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she shrugged her shoulders
and sighed impatiently. &ldquo;Well, he can no longer
object, I think, seeing that he is to be married himself....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky made a little quick movement, almost knocking
over a vase of flowers standing at his elbow; he
recovered himself with an effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why, I thought....&rdquo; he
broke off. &ldquo;He did not say anything about it to me
when I met him in Paris,&rdquo; he said lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Her handsome eyes searched his agitated face
critically. &ldquo;Well, he is to be married all the same,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I heard from him only this morning. He
is engaged to Tom Clare&rsquo;s widow&ndash;&ndash;Tubby Clare, I
believe he was always called.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>
<p>When Micky left Mrs. Ashton he raced off to
meet Marie.</p>
<p>She was looking quite her prettiest, in dark
furs with a bunch of violets in the breast of her coat,
but Micky would not have noticed if she had been
shabby, his thoughts were elsewhere. He did not even
see that she wore the bracelet he had given her for a
Christmas present, or remember that he had once told
her violets were his favourite flowers.</p>
<p>He apologised breathlessly for being late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had an appointment,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Raymond&rsquo;s
mother; she wrote and asked me to call this afternoon.&rdquo;
He hesitated, then added, &ldquo;Did you know that Raymond
is going to be married? Oh, but, of course, you cannot
know, as Mrs. Ashton only knew this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s dark eyes opened; like most women, she
loved to hear of an engagement or marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At last!&ndash;&ndash;not to&ndash;&ndash;surely not to
that little girl at Eldred&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky flushed angrily. Did every one know about
Esther? he asked himself savagely. He answered shortly
that it was to Mrs. Clare, Tubby Clare&rsquo;s little widow.</p>
<p>Marie looked amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we all thought&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she said, then stopped,
remembering that Micky and Raymond had been great
friends. &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;ll be happy,&rdquo; she said lamely.</p>
<p>Micky laughed shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no comment.</p>
<p>There was an excited flush in her cheeks, and a nervous
note in her voice when she spoke; it was like old times
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
to be here with him again, until she met his eyes across
the little table, and then it seemed as if she were looking
into the face of a stranger, a man who was like Micky&ndash;&ndash;enough
like him to hurt, and yet not Micky at all.</p>
<p>She aroused herself to amuse him. Micky had always
told her she cheered him up in the old days, but this
afternoon he answered her in monosyllables, and she
saw with bitter mortification how often he looked at the
clock. At last she was driven to remark on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky, are you in a hurry to get away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She asked the question lightly, but there was a strained
note in her voice.</p>
<p>Micky did not look at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;no, not at all,&rdquo; he said hurriedly. &ldquo;But I suppose
we ought to be moving soon....&rdquo; There was
a little pause. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been nice seeing you again,&rdquo; he
added with an effort.</p>
<p>She sat staring down at her plate. Her pretty colour
had faded; she was very pale, and she bit her lip hard
to hide its trembling.</p>
<p>Suddenly she looked up at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky&ndash;&ndash;may I ask you a question?...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She picked up a teaspoon and twisted it nervously.
Micky watched her with apprehension; he knew what
was coming, and his heart sank.</p>
<p>If only she would be content to leave things as they
were; if only she would accept the friendship he was
willing to give and close the book of the past for ever.</p>
<p>He did not understand that it was because she cared
for him so much that at the risk of losing her self-respect
and pride she must ask him for the truth, must
know ...</p>
<p>He heard her catch her breath, then suddenly she
spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky ... why was it? What have I done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a quiver in her voice that set him on edge;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
he could not stand the sound of unhappiness in any
woman&rsquo;s voice, and he had once thought he loved
Marie....</p>
<p>He answered without looking at her, realising that
it was kinder to tell the truth out and have done with
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to have written to you&ndash;&ndash;I hope some day
you will try and forgive me, but ... but....&rdquo;
He could not go on for the life of him, but he had said
enough, and he knew that she understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean ... you mean that there is some one
else?&rdquo; she asked with stiff lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He looked at her white, stricken face, and
felt himself a brute.</p>
<p>It seemed an eternity before she could steady her
voice enough to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it&ndash;&ndash;is it some one I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; said Micky very gently. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t any
one you have ever seen&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She picked up her big muff suddenly and held it so
that her face was hidden; the little word of endearment
that had escaped Micky&rsquo;s lips had almost broken her
down. This was the end of all she had ever hoped for,
and for the moment she could not choke the anguish in
her heart.</p>
<p>The following silence seemed unending; then she
looked round for her gloves, and put them on, buttoning
them with shaking fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready if you are,&rdquo; she said. She did not look
at him, but it felt like dying to walk beside him out
of the shop and into the cold air and know that perhaps
this was the last time they would ever be alone, he and
she. Once her steps faltered a little, and Micky put
out his hand to steady her, but she drew away from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said in a whisper.</p>
<p>There was a taxi waiting at the roadside, and Micky
called to the man. There was a slight cold drizzle of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
rain falling as he held open the door. He would have
followed but she stopped him. &ldquo;I should like to go
alone, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up, and for a moment he saw her face in
the light of the taxi lamp; such a white, quivering face
it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie!...&rdquo; said Micky in a choked voice, but
she waved him away.</p>
<p>He stood there on the kerb till the taxi had whirled
out of sight, and once again he asked himself desperately
if it were all worth while, if he were not throwing away
the real thing for a chimera.</p>
<p>There was probably a no more unhappy man in London
at that moment than Micky Mellowes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>
<p>Esther had spent a week indoors with a cold,
and it was the longest she could ever remember.
June was kindness itself, and fussed and petted
and made much of her, but the days dragged.</p>
<p>There was only one thing to live for&ndash;&ndash;the post! And
though the rat-tat rang through the house three or four
times a day, there was never anything for Esther.</p>
<p>Her own letter to Paris remained unanswered. The
telegram for which she longed never came.</p>
<p>June watched her with a mixture of sympathy and
impatience.</p>
<p>What was the good of putting all one&rsquo;s eggs in the
same basket? she asked herself crossly. What was the
good of falling in love if nothing better than unhappiness
ever came of it? She began to hate the phantom
lover, as she called him, with increased hatred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re strong enough to go yet, you
know,&rdquo; she said to Esther one afternoon when they were
sitting together in the firelight. &ldquo;Write and tell Mrs.
Ashton you can&rsquo;t come for another week, or that you
can&rsquo;t go at all. I do wish you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised to go, and I must do something. I shall
be all right by Monday. Mrs. Ashton has waited long
enough as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked pale and ill, June thought angrily, and
put it all down to &ldquo;that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Mr. Mellowes come back from Paris yet?&rdquo;
Esther asked suddenly. June was faintly amazed; Esther
never spoke of Micky. She answered rather dubiously
that she did not know.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I expect he&rsquo;s having such a good time that he&rsquo;ll stay
for weeks,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I wish he would come back,
I want him to get on with my business....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mellowes....&rdquo; announced Lydia at the door.</p>
<p>June scrambled to her feet with a scream of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky! you villain! we were just talking about you.
When did you come back? Why haven&rsquo;t you been before?
What have you been doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dragged him over to the fire; she fussed over him
and told him he was just in time for tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther&rsquo;s been indoors a week with a cold,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t you get up, Esther. Micky won&rsquo;t
mind....&rdquo; She pushed Esther back amongst the
sofa pillows. &ldquo;Poor darling! She&rsquo;s really been quite ill,&rdquo;
she declared.</p>
<p>Micky said formally that he was sorry that she was
not well, but that the weather was enough to kill anybody;
he added that he had been in town since Sunday,
but ...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four days, and you&rsquo;ve not been to see me!&rdquo; said June.
&ldquo;What a shame, to neglect us so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been busy,&rdquo; Micky defended himself; &ldquo;I expected
to hear you had gone to Mrs. Ashton&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said to
Esther.</p>
<p>She raised her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;I am going on Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Micky blankly.</p>
<p>June had opened the door and was calling over the
balusters to Lydia for hot water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And bring lots of it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thirsty....&rdquo;
She came back into the room. &ldquo;The postman&rsquo;s just
come,&rdquo; she said with a nod and a smile to Esther. &ldquo;Lydia
will bring our letters up if there are any.&rdquo; She turned
again to Micky. &ldquo;Well, truant! And what have you
been doing? Having a good time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have not,&rdquo; Micky said decidedly. &ldquo;Paris is
not what it used to be, or I am not!&rdquo; He laughed.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the swindle?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>June began to answer, but stopped as Lydia came into
the room. She brought a jug of hot water. June danced
up to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No letters? I thought I heard the postman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One for Miss Shepstone,&rdquo; Lydia said smilingly.</p>
<p>Micky looked across at Esther&ndash;&ndash;her whole face was
transformed as she turned eagerly with outstretched
hand.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence, then she gave a little
sigh of utter contentment. June sniffed inelegantly&ndash;&ndash;Micky
looked hard into the fire; his heart was thumping;
that letter ought to have been delivered yesterday, he
knew; it was cursed bad luck that it should arrive while
he was here.</p>
<p>There was a little silence in the room while Esther
opened it. She seemed to have forgotten that she was
not alone. Her pale cheeks were flushed and her whole
face tremulous.</p>
<p>June was bustling about, making a great clatter with
the teacups. Micky got up and began to prowl round
the room; his nerves felt jumpy. Because he knew so
well who had written that letter he was sure every one
else must know it too. Presently June nudged him as she
passed. When he looked at her she made a little grimace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it awful?&rdquo; she said in a stage whisper.</p>
<p>Micky smiled stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I help get the tea?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Toast some
buns or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any to toast,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;Sit down
and make yourself at home. Esther!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she raised her
voice elaborately&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;are you going to have any tea, my
child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther had come to the end of her letter; she folded
it hurriedly and put it away; she cast a quick look at
Micky, but he did not see it. June was chattering away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Esther is going on Monday,&rdquo; she informed Micky,
&ldquo;and I shall be left once more to my lonesome. I&rsquo;m
not at all sure that I shall stay on myself,&rdquo; she added.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so jolly having some one to share this room
with me that I&rsquo;m not looking forward to my own eternal
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may not go after all,&rdquo; Esther said suddenly. There
was a note of nervousness in her voice. She coloured,
meeting June&rsquo;s amazed eyes.</p>
<p>June screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not go! Well, I never!&rdquo; She sat down in a heap
on the hearthrug staring at Esther. &ldquo;I never knew such
a girl,&rdquo; she complained. &ldquo;Micky, I appeal to you....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Micky was not going to be appealed to; he was
stolidly stirring his tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I can change my mind if I like?&rdquo; Esther
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t you who have changed your mind,&rdquo; June
cut in ironically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that phantom lover
of yours has said in his letter. Own up, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, and if it is?&rdquo; Esther demurred. &ldquo;I suppose
he has a right to say what he likes, hasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; But
she was laughing as she spoke; she felt wonderfully
happy and light-hearted. &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re jealous,&rdquo; she
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jealous, indeed!&rdquo; said June indignantly. Then suddenly
she sighed. &ldquo;Well, perhaps I am; who knows?
What does he say? or mayn&rsquo;t we ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky had stopped stirring his tea; there was a sort
of intentness about his big figure.</p>
<p>Esther looked at him, and suddenly she stiffened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what he says,&rdquo; she answered defensively.</p>
<p>June laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right&ndash;&ndash;sorry if I was inquisitive.&rdquo; She deliberately
turned and began talking to Micky; Esther was
left to herself, but she did not mind, she had enough
now to think about. The longed-for letter had come
at last.</p>
<p>She woke from her reverie with a start when Micky
rose and said he must be going.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you be so long before you come and see
me again,&rdquo; June said in her downright way. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t
go without that sample, Micky&ndash;&ndash;it will go in your pocket
quite easily.&rdquo; She darted off to her room to fetch it,
and Micky moved a step nearer to Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have had good news?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She looked up startled.</p>
<p>Micky&rsquo;s eyes flamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That being so, of course, it is useless for me to ask
if you have changed your mind yet?&rdquo; he said again.</p>
<p>Esther gave a stifled cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to insult me?&rdquo; she asked under her
breath.</p>
<p>He half smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, if it&rsquo;s an insult to ask you to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no time for more. June came back then
with her hands full of samples, which she proceeded to
stuff into Micky&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
<p>He submitted laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing I get run over!&rdquo; he said resignedly.
&ldquo;People will think I&rsquo;ve been robbing a beauty shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a fine advertisement for me, anyway,&rdquo;
June declared. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see all the halfpenny papers
coming out with great headlines? Tragic Death of a
Young Millionaire! Pockets Stuffed with June Mason&rsquo;s
Skin Food!&rdquo; She laughed merrily. &ldquo;That would be
worth something, eh, Micky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heartless woman!&rdquo; he answered. He turned to
Esther. &ldquo;Good-bye, Miss Shepstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther was glad that he did not offer to shake hands
with her; she was glad that June went to see him off.
As soon as the door had closed on them she took her
letter out again; she pressed the paper to her lips.</p>
<p>It was worth waiting for, worth the heartache and
disappointment; she closed her eyes for a moment and
thought of Raymond Ashton. How she must have misjudged
him in the past. It did not seem true now that
they had ever quarrelled, or parted in anger; that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
had ever been so unhappy that she did not want to
live....</p>
<p>June came running up the stairs; she was singing
cheerily; Esther smiled as she listened ... it must be
wonderful to be always as happy and light-hearted as
June.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dreamer?&rdquo; said June. She shut the door with
a little slam and came over to where her friend sat.
&ldquo;A penny for your thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at Esther&rsquo;s flushed face in the firelight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so everything is all right after all, eh?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>Esther nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not really going to Mrs. Ashton&rsquo;s after all,&rdquo;
she said with a sort of shamefaced delight. &ldquo;Only I
didn&rsquo;t want to say so in front of Mr. Mellowes....
Oh, aren&rsquo;t you glad?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, of course I am!&rdquo; said June heartily. &ldquo;But
for the life of me I can&rsquo;t understand how it is that this
man of yours has got such an influence over you. He&rsquo;s
only got to hold up his little finger and you&rsquo;re on your
knees. I&rsquo;m beginning to think he must be a kind of
wonder after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther did not answer for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t at all wonderful, really,
except to me, and&ndash;&ndash;and I love him, you see,&rdquo; she added
shyly. &ldquo;I suppose every man is wonderful to the woman
who loves him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until she&rsquo;s his wife,&rdquo; said June tartly. &ldquo;And then
she thinks he&rsquo;s all sorts of an idiot, and tells him so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Esther was too happy to take her seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never been in love,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or you wouldn&rsquo;t
talk like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I never wish to be in love, thank you,&rdquo; said
June. &ldquo;If you and Micky are samples of objects who
are in love....&rdquo; She made a little grimace, screwing
up her nose in disgust.</p>
<p>Esther coloured.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Micky!&rdquo; she said, surprised into using his Christian
name. &ldquo;Is he in love? How do you know he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bat, and I haven&rsquo;t known Micky years
for nothing. He hasn&rsquo;t been himself for a long time.
I&rsquo;ve seen it, though I haven&rsquo;t said a word. He&rsquo;s in love
right enough, there can&rsquo;t be any other explanation, seeing
that he&rsquo;s too rich to ever be in debt, and they are the
only two things that ever make a man miserable,&rdquo; she
added.</p>
<p>Esther wondered if June was trying to sound her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who the wretched female is,&rdquo; June
went on, puckering her brows. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to guess, but
it&rsquo;s no good. There was a Miss Deland he used to go
about with at one time, but I know that&rsquo;s all off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he engaged to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;not really! But her people wanted it, and Micky
didn&rsquo;t mind; he&rsquo;d have drifted into it sure enough if
something very tremendous hadn&rsquo;t happened to make him
change his mind. I know Micky&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;d have slipped into
matrimony as easily as he gets into a taxi, unless some
one had turned him away from it.&rdquo; She glanced down
at the letter in Esther&rsquo;s lap. &ldquo;Tell me what he says,&rdquo;
she coaxed. &ldquo;Take pity on a poor creature who hasn&rsquo;t
a phantom lover of her own, or a real one either,&rdquo; she
added laughing.</p>
<p>Esther hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m never quite sure whether you&rsquo;re laughing at me
or not,&rdquo; she said nervously. &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t mean
to, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>June laid her hand on Esther&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I laugh at every one and everything,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s only my way, and doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. Perhaps
I&rsquo;m a bit jealous&ndash;&ndash;because you love this phantom lover
so much better than you love me,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Esther drew the letter from its envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read you just a few little bits,&rdquo; she said shyly.
The blood surged into her pretty face.</p>
<p>June leaned back in a corner and closed her eyes. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
held a cigarette between her lips and puffed at it lazily.
There was a little silence; then Esther said suddenly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. It makes me feel too self-conscious. But
he just says that he doesn&rsquo;t want me to go into any berth
just yet. He says that he may be home very soon
now....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said June chagrined. &ldquo;And then, of course,
you&rsquo;ll be married and live happily ever after....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Esther. &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Charlie, curled up on his cushion, started to purr lazily.
Presently June flopped down on her knees beside him
and began stroking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll let me have Charlie when you&rsquo;re married, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; she said suddenly. &ldquo;I am sure the phantom lover
won&rsquo;t want him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther did not answer; she hated herself for remembering
that Raymond had once said he loathed cats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you how Micky went into a pond after a
drowning kitten, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; June asked reminiscently.
&ldquo;I should have loved him for that alone, if for nothing
else....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther made no comment. She moved a little, and
the letter slipped from her lap to the floor.</p>
<p>June picked it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or is it sacrilege to touch it?&rdquo; she asked teasingly.
She laid it on Esther&rsquo;s lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t help seeing the writing,&rdquo; she said,
after a moment. &ldquo;And, do you know, it&rsquo;s awfully like
Micky&rsquo;s! If I hadn&rsquo;t known it wasn&rsquo;t his I should have
declared it was,&rdquo; she said rather disconnectedly.</p>
<p>Esther grabbed the letter up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t his, anyway,&rdquo; she said sharply.</p>
<p>June laughed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Esther wrote to Mrs. Ashton that same night and
told her she must regretfully decline the offered
position; she gave no reason, but she permitted
herself a little sigh of regret when the letter was dispatched.</p>
<p>She would like to have gone; she would like to have
seen Raymond&rsquo;s home and to have got to know his
mother, but it was his wish that she should not go.</p>
<p>She tried to believe that she was happy in the knowledge
of his love, but in her heart she knew that she was
restless and dissatisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had something to do I should be ever so much
happier,&rdquo; she told June again and again, and June quite
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be awful, killing time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When I
think of the life I used to lead at home before I started
trying to improve people&rsquo;s complexions, I wonder I didn&rsquo;t
go mad. Nothing but silly tea-parties and scandal....
Ugh! But all the same Micky and I agreed that you
wouldn&rsquo;t like being at Mrs. Ashton&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky!&rdquo; said Esther scornfully. &ldquo;As if I care what
he thinks....&rdquo;</p>
<p>June looked mildly amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; she said smoothly. &ldquo;I suppose I may
mention his name sometimes, mayn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; She began
to laugh. &ldquo;Do you know that for once in my life I&rsquo;ve
been totally wrong with regard to you two? I was so
sure you&rsquo;d more than like each other&ndash;&ndash;I even thought it
quite possible that Micky might fall in love with you&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re
so exactly suited to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think so,&rdquo; said Esther drily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry
I can&rsquo;t oblige you by agreeing.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>June said &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; She yawned. &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo;
she added after a moment, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced that things
would have been different if it hadn&rsquo;t been for that
phantom lover of yours; you&rsquo;re so crazy about him.&rdquo;
There was a touch of exasperation in her voice.</p>
<p>Esther flushed angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s absurd of you to talk like this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr.
Mellowes is the last man on earth I should ever have
looked at, even supposing Raymond....&rdquo; She had
spoken the name before she was aware of it; in her
momentary flash of temper the secret she had so carefully
guarded escaped her.</p>
<p>It was too late to attempt to cover what she had said;
she knew by the sudden expression of June&rsquo;s face that
she had heard.</p>
<p>There was a poignant silence, then June sat up with
a little jerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, that&rsquo;s let the cat out of the bag,&rdquo; she said
curtly. &ldquo;And you let me run him down! How mean,
how unutterably mean of you, Esther!... I can&rsquo;t
think now why I never guessed! Raymond Ashton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther had flushed scarlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said that was his name,&rdquo; she tried to defend
herself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s purely your imagination. And even supposing
it is, do you think I mind what you say about him,
or Mr. Mellowes either? Neither of you know him as
I do, or you would never say such cruel, wicked things.&rdquo;
She stopped with a sob in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is Raymond Ashton?&rdquo; June said gently. She
got up and came over to where Esther was sitting. &ldquo;Oh,
I am sorry I said anything about him!&rdquo; she cried impulsively.
&ldquo;You ought to have stopped me. How on
earth was I to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you said; it&rsquo;s all untrue,&rdquo; Esther
protested stormily. &ldquo;Nothing you could ever say about
him would influence me or make me feel any differently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June got up for a cigarette; when she was nonplussed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
she invariably had to smoke; she took several agitated
puffs before she looked at her friend again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anything I said was in absolute innocence, you
know that,&rdquo; she said in distress. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d no more idea than
the dead that you and he.... So that&rsquo;s why he
doesn&rsquo;t want you to go to his mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know; I never told him it was to Mrs.
Ashton&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;I just said I had had an offer of a berth. I
suppose you are trying to make out now that he&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven bless the child!&rdquo; June cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying
to make out anything! I&rsquo;m struck all of a heap like!
as Lydia says. So he&rsquo;s the phantom lover, is he?...
Well&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t find any words to suit the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a phantom lover,&rdquo; Esther protested. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
a real lover, a very real lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June stopped and took her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let you quarrel with me over him, no
matter how badly you want to,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No man is
worth two friends having a row over. I&rsquo;m quite prepared
to take him to my arms and love him if you do....
Oh, Esther, don&rsquo;t look like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were tears in Esther&rsquo;s eyes, and her lips were
trembling. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re making fun of me,&rdquo; she protested.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unkind of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June turned away; she wondered if perhaps, after all,
she and every one else had thoroughly misunderstood
Raymond, and if this girl&rsquo;s warm championing of him
was deserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not nearly good enough for her,&rdquo; she was telling
herself indignantly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll never really be happy with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t tell Mr. Mellowes, or any one else,&rdquo;
Esther was saying defiantly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want my affairs
talked over by every one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not tell any one,&rdquo; June said quietly.</p>
<p>She stood looking down into the fire, and her face was
troubled.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>Presently she walked to Esther, and, stooping, kissed
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It makes our
friendship seem so much more real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther smiled faintly.</p>
<p>But June was ill at ease. She felt instinctively that
things were not all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the man himself,&rdquo; she told herself obstinately.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some foolish, mistaken ideal of him that she has
created.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wondered what he really was doing in Paris.
Micky would know&ndash;&ndash;he and Micky had been such great
friends. There would be no harm in speaking of him
to Micky, at least that would not be betraying any secret
or confidence.</p>
<p>She rang Micky up the following morning. She made
the excuse that she wanted to see him on business. She
took him to lunch at her club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look well,&rdquo; was her greeting. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter, Micky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky frowned. If there was one thing he hated it
was for any one to remark on his appearance. He
answered brusquely that he had never been better in
his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, I was going to write when you rang
up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some tickets for a first night
to-morrow. Would you care to come along and&ndash;&ndash;and
bring Miss Shepstone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>June beamed. She liked going out with Micky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should love it,&rdquo; she said with enthusiasm. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
answer for Esther, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to persuade her,&rdquo; he urged carelessly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
suppose she&rsquo;s been about much; it would do her good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me she loves theatres,&rdquo; June admitted; &ldquo;but
the trouble will probably be that she hasn&rsquo;t got a dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dress?&rdquo; Micky echoed vaguely. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you lend
her one of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>June laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, she&rsquo;s much taller than me and slimmer.
... However, I&rsquo;ll see what can be done. Where shall
we meet you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call for you at seven. We&rsquo;ll have some grub first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! And if Esther won&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if she won&rsquo;t, you come along, of course;
but try and persuade her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s refused Mrs. Ashton&rsquo;s offer, you know,&rdquo; June
said presently. She kept her eyes lowered; she felt self-conscious
and guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she?&rdquo; Micky did not sound particularly interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; the phantom lover objected, or something, and
I think it&rsquo;s just as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said something about it when I had tea with you
the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she did. I dare say that wretched Raymond would
have tried to make love to her if she had gone,&rdquo; she
added deliberately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s away just now,&rdquo; Micky said quickly. &ldquo;I ran
across him when I was over in Paris last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you? What&rsquo;s he doing there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing particular; he often goes over, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand that man,&rdquo; June said, after a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Micky&rsquo;s voice was casual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never could see why you were so thick with him,&rdquo;
she went on.</p>
<p>Micky laughed lazily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps because I haven&rsquo;t your gift of second sight,
my dear,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought it would need second sight
to see what he is,&rdquo; June declared.</p>
<p>She looked across at Micky and was surprised by the
hard expression of his face. &ldquo;I hate men who flirt,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
she added. &ldquo;Micky, do you know that I&rsquo;ve got a kind
of feeling about Esther&rsquo;s phantom lover that he doesn&rsquo;t
really exist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky sat up with sudden attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that he isn&rsquo;t really a tangible man,&rdquo; she explained
haltingly.</p>
<p>Micky laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, he is,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>June caught her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&ndash;&ndash;oh, do you mean that you know
him?&rdquo; she asked excitedly.</p>
<p>Micky met her eyes with a faintly ironical smile in
his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know him,&rdquo; he answered hardily. &ldquo;And so
do you. My dear, I may be very green, but your careful
questioning wouldn&rsquo;t deceive a mouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky!&rdquo; said June indignantly. She flushed all over
her face, and her queer eyes blazed angrily. She really
felt that she had a done a dreadful thing in having
allowed him to guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t look so upset,&rdquo; Micky said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
not told me anything; I knew it long before you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When? How&ndash;&ndash;oh, Micky, do tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to tell. Ashton often spoke about
her to me. I knew she was at Eldred&rsquo;s, and&ndash;&ndash;well that&rsquo;s
all,&rdquo; he added lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All!&rdquo; said June disappointedly. &ldquo;But surely you know
more than that! What do you think of him? Do you
think he really cares for her? Oh, Micky, do you think
he&rsquo;s good enough for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky looked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it matters very much what I think,&rdquo;
he said drily. &ldquo;She&ndash;&ndash;she loves him apparently, and that&rsquo;s
all that counts, I imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she loves him right enough,&rdquo; June admitted
gloomily. &ldquo;It was quite an accident that she told me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
his name, of course, and she made me promise not to
tell any one, particularly you. I suppose because she
knows that you and he were friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly, if she does know. I rather doubt if Ashton
said much to her about me, though. He used to keep
things to himself a good deal.&rdquo; He picked up the menu.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to have anything more to eat? I
thought you were hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not now; I&rsquo;m too excited. Micky, when you saw
him in Paris, didn&rsquo;t he say anything, ask you anything?
Oh, it all seems so extraordinary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, what could he ask me?&rdquo; Micky objected
gently. &ldquo;I never discuss&ndash;&ndash;Miss Shepstone with him, and
he is not in the least likely to tell me his private affairs,
and I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want to know them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June was silent for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther is laying up trouble for herself,&rdquo; she said then.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think she is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thought about it,&rdquo; Micky maintained stolidly.
&ldquo;And if you take my advice, you won&rsquo;t either. It never
does to meddle with other people&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s my friend,&rdquo; June objected hotly. &ldquo;And do
you mean to say that I have got to stand by and see her
ruin her life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not married yet,&rdquo; he said laconically. &ldquo;Have
some tipsy cake, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t want any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do. Waitress....&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a deliberate attempt to change the conversation,
and June knew it; she sat back in her chair frowning.</p>
<p>She supposed Micky would not talk about Ashton because
he was his friend; men were so absurdly loyal to
one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you loved Esther as much as I do,&rdquo; she said suddenly,
&ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t stand by and say nothing while she
goes and marries that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky was prodding the tipsy cake with a fork.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t married him yet,&rdquo; he said stoically. &ldquo;And
if she&rsquo;s happy&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t, my good man! at least only in theory!&rdquo;
June declared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Raymond Ashton she really
cares for, but some wonderful person she thinks he is.
She is looking at him through rose-coloured glasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what most women do, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;My dear girl, don&rsquo;t get so upset; I thought you wanted
to bring me out to talk business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is business, my business at least, even if you&rsquo;re
not interested. No wonder you didn&rsquo;t want her to go
to Mrs. Ashton&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky coloured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;I thought it would be better not, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June regarded him severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a deep soul,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I never even guessed
that you knew anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you? And I don&rsquo;t know anything. Can&rsquo;t
we talk about something else?&rdquo; he asked plaintively.</p>
<p>It was getting on his nerves, this constant conversation
about Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll come along to-morrow, eh?&rdquo; he asked
presently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long time since we went for a little
jaunt together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall love it.&rdquo; But June answered absently; her
thoughts were still with Esther.</p>
<p>Silence fell. Micky had finished his tipsy cake and
was leaning back in his chair, a cigarette hanging dejectedly
between his lips. He had lit it, but it had gone
out, and though matches stood beside him he made no
effort to light it again.</p>
<p>June watched him across the table. He didn&rsquo;t look a
bit well, she thought. What was the matter with him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Micky,&rdquo; she said impulsively, &ldquo;I had quite
made up my mind that you and Esther were to fall in
love with one another. It would have been ideal, wouldn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; she asked wickedly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>A little spasm crossed Micky&rsquo;s face, but it was gone
so quickly June could never be quite sure if she had not
imagined it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ideal,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know about to-morrow,&rdquo; June said, as
they parted. &ldquo;I shall have to wear the same old purple
frock I wore when you took me out last time; you won&rsquo;t
mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, as long as you come; and ... let me
know about Miss Shepstone. If she won&rsquo;t come I&rsquo;ll give
the ticket away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know,&rdquo; said June vaguely.</p>
<p>She walked home deep in thought. So Micky had
known all along? She was not quite sure that she was
pleased with him for keeping the fact from her. They
had been such pals, he and she; surely he might have
trusted her and told her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;m not to be trusted with a secret, though,&rdquo;
she thought with a comical sigh. &ldquo;Look how easily I
gave Esther&rsquo;s away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tea was ready when she got in, and Esther and Charlie
sat curled up together in the firelight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an invitation for us both to-morrow night,&rdquo;
June said, even as she opened the door.</p>
<p>Esther looked up eagerly; she had had rather a dull
day of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A theatre,&rdquo; said June. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s from Micky. I tell you
at once, so you shan&rsquo;t throw cold water on it. He&rsquo;s got
some seats for a first night, and asks us both to go. What
do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a dress,&rdquo; said Esther promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him you&rsquo;d say that,&rdquo; June answered calmly,
&ldquo;and he said it didn&rsquo;t matter&ndash;&ndash;or something to that effect.
Micky never notices what you wear,&rdquo; she went on airily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to wear an old purple rag that I&rsquo;ve had for
about forty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther laughed. &ldquo;I dare say I can buy one in time,&rdquo;
she said; she did not intend Micky to think she could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
not afford a frock. &ldquo;I think I should rather like to go,&rdquo;
she added shyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; June hid the amazement she felt. &ldquo;Well,
Micky&rsquo;s going to call for us and take us out to dinner
first. It&rsquo;ll be a scrumptious dinner&ndash;&ndash;Micky always does
the thing in style!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of him to ask me,&rdquo; Esther said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; June demanded. &ldquo;Oh, you mean because you
don&rsquo;t like one another? But that wouldn&rsquo;t trouble Micky;
he&rsquo;d take you out if he hated the sight of you, he&rsquo;s so
kind-hearted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for a doubtful compliment,&rdquo; said Esther.</p>
<p>She was making plans rapidly in her mind. Micky
had never seen her well dressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had another cheque from Raymond this morning,&rdquo;
she said flushing. &ldquo;So it will come in useful. I can get
a ready-made frock&ndash;&ndash;I shan&rsquo;t look so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll look an angel whatever you wear,&rdquo; said June
affectionately. &ldquo;I know a little woman just off the Brompton
Road who&rsquo;ll fix you up,&rdquo; June said eagerly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
got the tiniest shop, but it&rsquo;s cram full of the sweetest
things. She&rsquo;s awfully nice, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford much,&rdquo; Esther said dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t charge you much,&rdquo; June declared. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
a friend of mine. She has my creams on her counter.
It&rsquo;s a fine advertisement, you see. She gets lots of
actresses and smart people in, and they ask what it is,
and try a jar and send for more, and, there you
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;s too expensive&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>But she ended by paying much more than she had
originally intended. There was such a gem of a frock&ndash;&ndash;black
velvet and a white transparent bodice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look a duck!&rdquo; June declared. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she,
Fifine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the mirror told Esther how charming she really
looked without any further words.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I really ought not to have spent so much,&rdquo; she said
as they went home. &ldquo;But it is rather nice, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky will be absolutely bowled over,&rdquo; June declared.
&ldquo;I shall have to take a back seat all the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Micky apparently was &ldquo;bowled over,&rdquo; judging by
the look that crept into his eyes when he arrived and
found Esther alone in the sitting-room.</p>
<p>June was late, as usual; she called out to him from
her room that she wouldn&rsquo;t be half a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hurry,&rdquo; Micky answered quickly. He went
over to where Esther stood, a little flushed and shy in
her new frock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you to come,&rdquo; he said rather agitatedly.
She looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you to ask me,&rdquo; she answered. She
felt much more at her ease with him now. She knew
that she was looking particularly pretty. &ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t
the first time we have had dinner together, is it?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>He answered eagerly that he was glad she remembered;
he had almost thought she must have forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shall never forget that, though it seems so long
ago since that night. I was unhappy then, but now....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now?&rdquo; he asked as she paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now everything has come right,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;You
said you were sure it would, if you remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face changed a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad I was such a good prophet,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>June came bustling in; she was flushed and breathless,
and laden with flowers, fan, and gloves, all of which
she dropped to the sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite ready. Esther, where&rsquo;s my cloak? Do find
it, there&rsquo;s an angel. Oh, and my slippers&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve got everything
else....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was at least another ten minutes before they
were in the taxi and racing away through the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve booked a table at Marnio&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Micky said. &ldquo;I hope
you like Marnio&rsquo;s, June?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I like anything to-night,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to enjoy myself thoroughly, whatever happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky glanced at Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Miss Shepstone?&rdquo; he asked rather nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther&rsquo;s too excited to speak,&rdquo; June answered for her.
&ldquo;Oh, are we here already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led the way into the lounge of the big restaurant;
Micky was well known here apparently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one in London knows Micky,&rdquo; June whispered
to Esther with a sort of pride. &ldquo;Look at the attention
he gets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther glanced at him; probably anybody with Micky&rsquo;s
money could get the same attention, she thought.</p>
<p>There were a good many people in the lounge; Esther
looked at them interestedly. Some of the women were
beautifully dressed, but the black and white frock held
its own bravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look nicer than any of them,&rdquo; June told her.
&ldquo;I knew&ndash;&ndash;hullo!&ndash;&ndash;Micky&rsquo;s found a friend.&rdquo; She looked
across to where he was standing, and Esther followed
her gaze.</p>
<p>Micky was talking to two ladies&ndash;&ndash;one of them was
young and rather pretty, and the other&ndash;&ndash;Esther&rsquo;s face
flushed suddenly, and she bit her lip hard, for the other
was Mrs. Ashton, Raymond&rsquo;s mother.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>
<p>Esther unconsciously put out her hand and
grasped June&rsquo;s arm; she would have given anything
had it been possible to run away. She saw Mrs.
Ashton turn and look towards where they were standing,
and in another moment she had crossed the lounge and
was shaking hands with June.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just inviting Mr. Mellowes to come and dine
with us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But he tells me he already has an
engagement.&rdquo; Her eyes smiled at June. &ldquo;I suppose you
are the engagement?&rdquo; she submitted.</p>
<p>June laughed.</p>
<p>A string band was playing a ragtime tune when they
entered the restaurant. To Esther&rsquo;s unaccustomed eyes
the room with its flowers and many lights was the most
wonderful place she had ever seen. She kept close to
Micky as he threaded his way through the small tables
till he found their own, rather at the end of the room
and away from the noisy band.</p>
<p>He put Esther into a comfortable chair and himself
took her cloak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind being left while I go back for June?&rdquo;
he asked hurriedly; &ldquo;she seems to have got lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther looked after him as he went quickly back down
the length of the room. She liked him in evening dress.
If only it had been Raymond instead!&ndash;&ndash;she stifled a little
sigh; she meant to enjoy herself this evening; she was
not going to allow one single despondent thought.</p>
<p>June and Micky rejoined her almost at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought some one had eloped with you,&rdquo; June said
laughingly. &ldquo;Where did you get to? Micky, how hot
this room is&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m just stifling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw off her wrap and snatched up a paper fan
from the table. Micky sat down between the two girls.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Shepstone didn&rsquo;t want to see Mrs. Ashton, I
rather fancy,&rdquo; he said coolly. He looked at Esther with
a slight smile in his eyes. &ldquo;I believe she was afraid Mrs.
Ashton would demand a reason for having had her kind
offer so cavalierly refused,&rdquo; he went on banteringly.</p>
<p>Esther laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe I was,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an awful
coward over explaining things to people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said Micky drily. He was wondering
how he was ever going to explain the most difficult occurrence
of his whole life, and if, when he had done so, it
would ever be believed.</p>
<p>He looked at Esther a great deal during dinner; he
had never seen her so animated; her eyes were sparkling,
and her cheeks were flushed; she talked a great deal,
and was particularly friendly to him; he was quite sorry
when it was time to go on to the theatre.</p>
<p>As they left the restaurant he noticed that she kept
close to him again, and that she looked anxiously round
for Mrs. Ashton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s upstairs in the gallery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled. She thought he was very quick to understand
her. Raymond had never seemed to understand
things without an explanation. She wished he had been
rather more like Micky in some ways; she wished&ndash;&ndash;she
looked up at Micky guiltily; how could she compare the
two men?&ndash;&ndash;the one whom she loved, and the other
whom she did not even like!</p>
<p>They were late, and the curtain had risen when they
were shown into their seats. The theatre was dark, and
Esther could hardly see her way. She put out her hand
with a smothered laugh and felt for Micky&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
see,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>His fingers closed about hers; such a little hand it
felt. He wondered why she was being so kind to him
to-night. He did not realise that she was enjoying
herself so much that she felt on good terms with the
whole world.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>Esther sat between him and June, and Micky hardly
looked at the stage at all. His eyes turned again and
again to her rapt face and the eagerness of her eyes.</p>
<p>She had been to theatres lots of times, so she told him
in a whisper, but never in the stalls before. She asked
him if he didn&rsquo;t like some of the frocks worn by the
people close by.</p>
<p>Micky&rsquo;s eyes flashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so well as yours,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She drew away from him a little, and he wished he
had not said it. In that one moment he felt that he had
broken down all the friendliness she had shown him that
evening. She did not speak again for some time.</p>
<p>In the interval June leaned over to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you bored, Micky? You look bored to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky stifled a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said rather wearily.</p>
<p>His eyes wandered round the crowded house. There
were several people in the stalls whom he knew. He
noticed that people were looking at Esther, and he felt
a little thrill of pride.</p>
<p>They were wondering who she was, of course. He
wished with all his heart that he could stand up in his
seat and announce to an interested world that she was
the woman he intended to marry.</p>
<p>When the light went down again Esther leaned a little
closer to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mellowes&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Micky bent his head towards her eagerly. He
could hear her agitated breathing, hear too the little
quiver in her voice when she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see who was in that box on the right?&ndash;&ndash;the
lower box.... I thought it was Mrs. Ashton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky answered casually that very likely it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd, eh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we should dine at the same
place and have tickets for the same show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther said &ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;yes&rdquo; twice in nervous hurry.</p>
<p>There was something strained and unnatural about her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
and though Micky could not see her face clearly he knew
that something had happened to distress her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked anxiously. &ldquo;Is anything the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.... No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat very still till the curtain fell again, but Micky
had the feeling that she was not paying the least attention
to what was going on on the stage, and he knew that her
eyes turned again and again to the stage box. What
was she afraid of, he asked himself in perplexity, even
if Mrs. Ashton did see her and recognize her, surely&ndash;&ndash;then
in a flash he knew ... the light had been turned
up suddenly, and in that moment he saw the figure of
a man move quickly from the front of the box to the
screen of the curtains.</p>
<p>Micky gripped the arms of his seat; for the moment
he could not move.</p>
<p>It was Raymond&ndash;&ndash;he knew it as certainly as if he had
been told.</p>
<p>No doubt he had seen Esther, whilst she ... poor
child! Had she seen him too?</p>
<p>He looked down at her; she was sitting up stiffly,
her hands clasped in the lap of the new frock of which
she had been so innocently proud; her face was as white
as the soft tulle of her sleeves, and her eyes were fixed
on the box with its velvet curtains where Mrs. Ashton
sat laughing and chatting with a girl in a pink frock.</p>
<p>They both turned from time to time to some one who
stood behind them in the shadow; once the curtains
moved a little and a man&rsquo;s hand and arm showed distinctly.</p>
<p>Micky could bear it no longer; he touched Esther&rsquo;s
clasped hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ill?&ndash;&ndash;would you like me to take you out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no ... please leave me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June had discovered a friend in a seat a row or two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
ahead with whom she was trying to carry on a conversation;
she had no eyes for Micky or Esther. Micky gave a
sigh of relief when the lights were lowered again; he
could feel all that Esther was suffering, he could put
himself in her place so thoroughly.</p>
<p>If he went round to the box and made sure if it were
Ashton, perhaps that would be the best way; he could
manage to give him the tip then to keep out of the way.
He half rose in his seat, but Esther moved at once, laying
her fingers on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t leave me here,&rdquo; she said tremulously.</p>
<p>It was not the man himself she wanted, but his presence
somehow gave her a feeling of confidence; if, indeed,
it was Raymond up there in the box. She tried to argue
herself out of the fancy; he would have let her know if
he had come to London&ndash;&ndash;surely she would have been the
first to whom he would have come; she was mad to ever
think the man up there in the background could be Raymond.</p>
<p>But the conviction was there in her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is he&ndash;&ndash;I know it&rsquo;s he,&rdquo; something in her heart was
saying over and over again obstinately.</p>
<p>The rest of the play seemed endless; she rose with a
quick breath of thankfulness when it was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in a hurry,&rdquo; June said. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you enjoyed
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, oh yes, but it&rsquo;s hot&ndash;&ndash;I want to get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky was deliberately being as slow as he could&ndash;&ndash;he
blocked the way out obstinately; the stalls were almost
empty when at last they left them.</p>
<p>June touched his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky&ndash;&ndash;is&ndash;&ndash;Esther ill? Look how white she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther was some little way ahead of them; she seemed
to be trying to get out as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too hot for her, poor darling!&rdquo; June said.
&ldquo;Micky&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky laughed savagely.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but Ashton was up in that
box with his mother, and she saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He silenced her with a frown. He followed
Esther as quickly as he could, but she was outside
in the cold night air before he overtook her. There
was a crowd here too&ndash;&ndash;rows of cars and carriages outside,
and women in thin evening frocks and furs shivering
in the cold wind.</p>
<p>Micky drew Esther&rsquo;s hand through his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall find our cab this way, I think,&rdquo; he said
evenly.</p>
<p>He had seen Mrs. Ashton only a few yards away, and
he dreaded every moment that Esther would see her, and
see, too, who was with her.</p>
<p>A sudden block in the crowd momentarily hindered
them, and in that second a man&rsquo;s light laugh rang out
above the noise and chatter of voices.</p>
<p>Micky felt the girl beside him give a convulsive start.
She tried to drag her fingers from his, but he held them
fast.</p>
<p>The crowd was moving again now; a second, and
Raymond and his mother were lost to sight.</p>
<p>Micky had slipped an arm round Esther; he was white
to the lips. He knew now how near he had been to
discovery and the wreck of all his hopes. He tried to
pretend that he did not understand the cause of her
agitation. He looked down at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better now you&rsquo;re in the air?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It was hot
in the theatre. I&ndash;&ndash;Esther&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had swung heavily against him, and looking down
in sudden alarm, Micky saw that she had fainted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>
<p>Looking back to that night at the theatre it always
seemed to June Mason that she had been most
extraordinarily blind in not seeing before that it
was Esther for whom Micky Mellowes cared.</p>
<p>One glance at his face as he lifted the girl in his arms
told her more than any words would have done; there
was a sort of indescribable rage and pain in his eyes as
he looked down at the white face lying against his shoulder.</p>
<p>People gathered about them, curious and sympathetic.
June heard some one say that it had been so &ldquo;deuced
hot in the theatre, no wonder people fainted,&rdquo; but she
knew all the time that it was nothing to do with the
heat; she stooped mechanically and picked up Esther&rsquo;s
gloves which had fallen from her nerveless hand before
she followed Micky back into the foyer, where he laid
Esther down on one of the long velvet lounges.</p>
<p>Afterwards she realised that the sudden discovery that
Micky loved her friend had been something of a shock
to her, that she had even been faintly jealous; she did not
want to marry him herself, and yet they had been such
good friends, it gave her an odd little pain to think that
there was somebody else whom he placed a long way
ahead of her in his heart.</p>
<p>Most of the people had gone, one or two of the theatre
attendants lingered; it seemed a long time before Esther
opened her eyes. She lay for a moment, looking vaguely
about her, then her eyes came back to Micky, who was
bending over her, his face scarcely less white than her
own.</p>
<p>She made an effort to lift herself from his arm; then
quite suddenly she burst into tears.</p>
<p>The little sound of sobbing broke the spell that seemed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
to have held June; she went down on her knees beside
her, both arms round the slender, shaking figure.</p>
<p>Micky had risen to his feet. June glanced up at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and find the taxi and leave her to me,&rdquo; she said
sharply. The look of suffering in his face hurt her.
Micky went out into the cold night bareheaded. He
hardly knew what he was doing. He stood for some
minutes on the path forgetting why he had come out at
all, before some one, jostling against him, brought him
back to a sense of time and place.</p>
<p>He went down the road to look for a taxi. When
he came back Esther was sitting up, wrapped in her
cloak. She was not crying now, but she looked like a
child who wants to cry but is determined not to.</p>
<p>June was standing beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re quite ready,&rdquo; she said. She kept an arm about
Esther, and Micky followed them silently.</p>
<p>He saw them into the cab, but did not follow. June
asked a sharp question: &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;at least, not if you can manage without me.&rdquo;
His voice sounded unnerved; he looked away from June
to where Esther was huddled into a corner beside her,
and suddenly, as if urged by an impulse he could not
control, he leaned forward, groped for her hand in the
darkness, and, bending, kissed it passionately.</p>
<p>A moment later he had stepped back and shut the door.</p>
<p>He stood looking after the cab till it vanished round
a corner, then he went back to the theatre for his hat
and coat, and set off again down the road.</p>
<p>He was not conscious of any real emotion; but he
walked swiftly as a man does who has a set purpose, and
he did not stop till he found himself outside the Ashtons&rsquo;
house.</p>
<p>It was not far off midnight, but lights burned in many
of the windows, and after a swift glance at the face of
the house he went up the steps and rang the bell.</p>
<p>It was some moments before the door was opened by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
a mildly amazed-looking servant; Micky asked for Mr.
Ashton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Mellowes,&rdquo; he said, as she obviously
hesitated. &ldquo;If you tell him my name he will see me. I
know he is in, I saw him at the Comedy Theatre
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped past the girl into the hall, and after a
slightly scared glance at him she shut the door and
departed upstairs.</p>
<p>A moment later Micky heard Ashton&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You old night-bird! What an ungodly hour to call
on any one! I was just going to bed; come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke easily, but there was a slightly anxious look
in his eyes; he led the way into the library.</p>
<p>The fire was nearly out there and the room felt chilly;
he shivered, and, stooping, tried to rake the cinders into
a blaze.</p>
<p>Micky watched him silently; after a moment Ashton
turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, man! what&rsquo;s the matter? You look as cheerful
as Doomsday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky was standing stiffly against the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you in the theatre to-night,&rdquo; he began without
preamble. &ldquo;I was with Miss Shepstone, and she saw you,
too&ndash;&ndash;at least she believes it was you, and I am going to
tell her that she was mistaken. How soon can you get
out of town and back to Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashton stared; the colour had rushed to his face;
after a moment his eyes fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the devil you&rsquo;re driving at,&rdquo; he
said irritably. &ldquo;I suppose I can come to London without
asking you first, can&rsquo;t I? And, as for Lallie&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he
grinned nervously&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;well, you know as well as I do that
that&rsquo;s all been off for weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky stood immovable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t answered my question,&rdquo; he said flintily.
&ldquo;How soon can you get out of London?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>Ashton swore under his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dashed if I know what you&rsquo;re driving at,&rdquo; he said
sulkily. &ldquo;If you like to take Lallie to theatres, that&rsquo;s
your business; she&rsquo;s a nice little girl, I admit, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky took a step forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to make me forget that this is your
mother&rsquo;s house, you&rsquo;re going the right way to do it,&rdquo; he
said between his teeth. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t want any of your
bluff. Miss Shepstone thinks she saw you at the Comedy
to-night; she&rsquo;ll probably write to you or try to see you
in the morning, and you&rsquo;ve got to be out of London by
then&ndash;&ndash;do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashton laughed; he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must?&rdquo; he said nastily. &ldquo;How long have you been
Lallie&rsquo;s champion?... Oh, all right, all right,&rdquo; he
broke off hurriedly, as he saw the ugly light in Micky&rsquo;s
eyes. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a bit thick, you know,&rdquo; he resumed injuredly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done with her; you know that. You sent
my letter on to her yourself. It&rsquo;s absurd if I can&rsquo;t come
back home for a few days in case she should see me
and get upset. I&rsquo;m sorry if she&rsquo;s still fond of me, but,
dash it all&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t answered my question,&rdquo; said Micky
again.</p>
<p>He was controlling himself with a mighty effort, but
the veins stood out like cords on his forehead and his
hands were clenched.</p>
<p>The two men looked at one another, and it was Ashton&rsquo;s
eyes that fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to bullyrag me....&rdquo; he began
blusteringly, &ldquo;I may as well tell you that I&rsquo;m not going
back to Paris till I please, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Micky. He turned on his heel.</p>
<p>Raymond watched him cross the room anxiously.
When he reached the door he called to him&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky! What the devil are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Micky answered without turning&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell Mrs. Clare the way you&rsquo;ve treated
Miss Shepstone, and if she&rsquo;s half the decent sort I think
she is she&rsquo;ll throw you overboard as you&rsquo;ve thrown
scores of others....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashton followed and clutched his arm. &ldquo;Come back;
don&rsquo;t be such a firebrand! I&rsquo;ll go&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll clear out by the
first train to-morrow.... I&rsquo;m sorry if Esther was
upset, but....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky cut him short. &ldquo;The first train leaves Victoria
at 9.40; I&rsquo;ll be there to see you off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashton scowled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice way to treat a friend,&rdquo;
he grumbled. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s really anything up with Lallie
...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky stood like a statue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s decent of you to take her out,&rdquo; Ashton went on
uneasily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, I&rsquo;m sure. She&rsquo;s
never had much of a time. If I&rsquo;d had any money....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky broke out then. &ldquo;Oh, hold your infernal
tongue,&rdquo; he said furiously.</p>
<p>He walked out of the room, shutting the door hard
behind him. He passed the astonished maid in the hall
and let himself out into the night. The blood was pounding
in his veins, he felt in actual need of physical
violence; he did not know how he had managed to keep
his hands off Raymond. He walked on at a furious pace;
presently he laughed with a sort of self-pity.</p>
<p>What was the good of what he had done after all?
At best he had only succeeded in staving off the inevitable
for a little while; Esther would have to know
sooner or later.</p>
<p>Such wasted love it was! All for a man who was not
worth one thought, or even a tear!</p>
<p>When he got back to his rooms he told Driver to call
him early, as he was going to see somebody off by train.
He was at Victoria long before Ashton; the greeting
between the two men was constrained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going back to-day, anyway,&rdquo; Ashton said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
jauntily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be married the day after to-morrow&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
He looked at Micky with triumphant eyes.
&ldquo;To Mrs. Clare,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When Micky got back to his rooms, Driver met him;
Driver with a spark of unwonted animation in his dull
eyes, and who closed the sitting-room door mysteriously
behind him as he came forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir&ndash;&ndash;there is a lady to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady!&rdquo; said Micky blankly; then he laughed. &ldquo;Rubbish!
You&rsquo;re dreaming, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sir,&rdquo; said Driver stolidly.</p>
<p>Micky stared at him for a moment, then he passed him,
and threw open the door of the sitting-room.</p>
<p>It was Esther who rose from a chair by the fire as
he entered.</p>
<p>For an instant Micky was unable to believe his own
eyes, then he shut the door and took a step forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never thought....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke in agitatedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know; I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t have come; I
don&rsquo;t know what June would say if she knew; but&ndash;&ndash;but
there wasn&rsquo;t anybody else I could come to, and you
said ... you said....&rdquo; She flushed up nervously.
&ldquo;Oh, you did say you would be a friend to me,
didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Micky.</p>
<p>He might have reminded her that she had declined his
friendship; he might have reminded her of all the not
very kind things which she had said to him, but it was
such happiness to see her here in his room that he was
in no mood to be critical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do sit down ... there&rsquo;s no hurry, is there?&rdquo;
He wanted to put her at her ease; he did not like to
see the nervous agitation in her face; but she shook her
head.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stay, only ... only I....&rdquo; Her
voice changed suddenly. &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Mellowes, will
you tell me how I can get to Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paris!&rdquo; Micky echoed the word helplessly. &ldquo;Paris!&rdquo;
he said again. For the moment he stared at her with
blank eyes.</p>
<p>She rushed on impetuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a friend there&ndash;&ndash;some one I ... some
one I ... oh, it&rsquo;s the man I&rsquo;m engaged to, and I
want to see him&ndash;&ndash;I must see him! I&rsquo;ve got the money
to get there. I hope you don&rsquo;t think I was going to
ask you to lend me that....&rdquo; she added in distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Shepstone ... I&ndash;&ndash;I....&rdquo; Micky was
horribly upset. &ldquo;I never thought anything of the sort.
And&ndash;&ndash;and even if you were going to ask me, you know
quite well that anything I have, anything....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped him hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know, it&rsquo;s very kind of you.&rdquo; Her blue eyes
sought his face with a sort of abasement. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;ve ever really realised how kind you&rsquo;ve been to me,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;But ... but I&rsquo;ve been so worried and
unhappy ... I&ndash;&ndash;I do hope you&rsquo;ll forgive me if I
was rude or unkind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky did not answer; so it had come at last, the
explanations which he had always dreaded; he racked
his brains in vain to think of a way out of it&ndash;&ndash;to make
out the best story he could.</p>
<p>She seemed to realise his perturbation, she came a step
nearer to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mellowes,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;will you tell me
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Micky inaudibly, but he did not look at
her.</p>
<p>She looked up at him, trying to see his face before
she asked her question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you&ndash;&ndash;do you know who the man is that I am
going to marry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the silence that followed her timid question, Micky
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
felt that he lived through years. Should he tell her the
truth, or should he not? Ashton was out of London by
this time; in another forty-eight hours he would be married
to another woman; he raised his head with a sort of
desperation. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He tried to comfort himself with the knowledge that
at least it was substantially the truth; she was not going
to marry Ashton&ndash;&ndash;she never could marry him now.</p>
<p>He heard the sigh of relief she gave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Somehow, lately, I have thought
that you did know. Mr. Mellowes ... last night ... I
thought I saw him in the theatre last night.
I know now that I was mistaken.&rdquo; She paused a moment
and looked past him to the window and the cold grey
street outside. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have seen him,&rdquo; she said
again, as if to convince herself rather than him. &ldquo;Because
he is in Paris&ndash;&ndash;I found out this morning that he is still
in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Micky. His voice sounded choked. &ldquo;And
so&ndash;&ndash;so you want to go out there to him, is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I should have told June only&ndash;&ndash;only she isn&rsquo;t
very sympathetic. You see&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she smiled faintly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;she
hates my &lsquo;phantom lover,&rsquo; as she calls him, and so&ndash;&ndash;so I
know she would only do her best to keep me from going
to him; but you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said Micky quietly, &ldquo;that I shall try
and do the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and looked at her squarely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never been to Paris,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and probably
you can&rsquo;t speak a word of French. You&rsquo;ve probably
never travelled any distance alone. Miss Shepstone, it&rsquo;s
impossible for you to go. I am only advising you for
your own good. Why not write to&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;your fianc&eacute; and
ask him to make arrangements for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off helplessly. The poor little letter in which
she had already done so lay in his pocket at that moment.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>It turned him sick to think of the tissue of lies and deceit
his own actions were forcing upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I have asked him,&rdquo; she said almost in a whisper,
&ldquo;but he said he couldn&rsquo;t have me&ndash;&ndash;then! But that&rsquo;s
quite a long time ago,&rdquo; she added hopefully. &ldquo;And I
thought if he saw me&ndash;&ndash;if I got there and surprised
him&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky turned away. He could imagine so well what
would happen if indeed she found Ashton. He walked
over to the window and stood looking into the street
with unseeing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a little patience,&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;Take
my advice and stay here. If he&ndash;&ndash;if he can, he will send
for you, I am sure.&rdquo; She looked up quickly, a spark
of anger in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sound as if you think that will never be,&rdquo; she
said sharply.</p>
<p>Micky met her gaze unflinchingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything of the sort. I know&ndash;&ndash;I know
if I were in his place, whoever he is&ndash;&ndash;I should be counting
the moments till I could ... could have you
with me.&rdquo; He smothered the momentary seriousness of
his words with a little laugh. &ldquo;And now, after that
pretty compliment, aren&rsquo;t you going to reward me by
taking my most excellent advice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost of a smile crossed her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted you to say something so different,&rdquo; she told
him wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&ndash;&ndash;but I&rsquo;m not going to. Any one would advise
you as I have. It isn&rsquo;t ... it isn&rsquo;t that I&rsquo;m prejudiced,
or anything like that. I would give a great deal
to see you happy. I hope you believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat twisting her hands together nervously. After
a moment she looked up at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She rose and began to pull on her gloves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s very dreadful of me to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
have come,&rdquo; she said deprecatingly. &ldquo;But ... but
this morning, somehow, I felt I must have someone to
talk to&ndash;&ndash;some one to advise me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am honoured that you came,&rdquo; said Micky gravely.
Her eyes fell before his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;and you won&rsquo;t tell June?&rdquo; she appealed.</p>
<p>He smiled rather sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not likely ever to tell any one,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know. Mr. Mellowes&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she held out her hand
to him suddenly, her fair face flushing&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I should like
to take back something I said to you one day. Perhaps
you don&rsquo;t remember, but I do, and lately&ndash;&ndash;especially since
last night, when you were so kind&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve felt that I wasn&rsquo;t
just to you; and so ... if you will forgive me, I
should like to be friends with you after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was crimson by the time she had finished, but
Micky took her hand without answering, held it for a
moment, then let it go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I mustn&rsquo;t offer you anything?&rdquo; he said
with forced lightness. &ldquo;No coffee&ndash;&ndash;or tea? It&rsquo;s cold
out this morning. If you would care for anything, my
man would bring it at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed and shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything, thank you.&rdquo; She looked round
at Micky&rsquo;s luxuriously furnished room. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it beautiful?&rdquo;
she asked him.</p>
<p>He smiled. &ldquo;Do you like it? I am glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s lovely.&rdquo; She looked up at him. &ldquo;I seem
to have been climbing a ladder lately,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Since
I left that awful place in the Brixton Road&ndash;&ndash;where I
am now is heaps better than that was, but this&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky was silent. It trembled on his lips to say that
everything he had in the world was hers if only she
would take it, but he knew the utter futility of it. Money
and possessions counted very little with her. She would
not have minded the house in the Brixton Road at all
with the man she loved.</p>
<p>He went downstairs with her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;So we&rsquo;re really friends now?&rdquo; he said when he bade
her good-bye. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll promise to let me advise you
again when you&rsquo;re not quite sure what you ought to
do?&rdquo; There was a note of anxiety in his voice.</p>
<p>She flushed nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of you to be interested.&rdquo; It seemed strange
to her that after all that had happened they should have
so easily got back to their old footing of friendliness.
But Micky was not at all happy. When she had gone
he stood for a long time at the window staring moodily
out.</p>
<p>When Driver brought lunch, he found Micky poring
over a Bradshaw; he spoke to the man with elaborate
carelessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to take another trip to Paris&ndash;&ndash;to-morrow
will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir.&rdquo; Driver smoothed a crease in the cloth. &ldquo;To
post another letter, sir?&rdquo; he asked expressionlessly.</p>
<p>Micky looked up sharply, but Driver met his eyes
innocently.</p>
<p>Micky coloured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it isn&rsquo;t a letter this time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to buy
a fur coat.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The phantom lover,&rdquo; said June Mason lugubriously,
&ldquo;is certainly turning up trumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a week later, and she was giving Micky
tea.</p>
<p>Esther was out. She knew now that it was to see
Esther he came. She was quite reconciled to the fact,
and had got over her first pang of jealousy, but Esther&rsquo;s
indifference to him enraged her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t the girl see what she&rsquo;s throwing away?&rdquo; she
asked herself furiously. &ldquo;What on earth is she made of
that she can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s waiting for her to take? If
Micky had adored me as he adores her ... well&ndash;&ndash;my
name wouldn&rsquo;t have been June Mason to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she kept such thoughts to herself and treated
Micky very much the same as usual, though unconsciously
there was a slight restraint in her manner, especially
when Esther was present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think that I&rsquo;ve misjudged our Raymond,&rdquo;
she went on laughingly. &ldquo;Perhaps some one has
converted him. Anyway, he&rsquo;s treating Esther handsomely.
First the money, and last week the fur coat....&rdquo;
Micky looked up with sudden interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s come, then, has it!&rdquo; he said eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! It&rsquo;s been here two days. How did you
know?&rdquo; she asked with sudden suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you talking about it. Wasn&rsquo;t it you? No?
Then it must have been Miss Shepstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; said June easily. &ldquo;I never saw any one
so delighted with a thing as she was with that coat. And
it is a beauty, Micky. I only hope it&rsquo;s paid for,&rdquo; she
added practically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t it be paid for?&rdquo; Micky said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></div>
<p>She made a little grimace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Raymond Ashton never paid for things if
he could help it; and you know he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she told him.
&ldquo;However, as he seems to be a reformed character, we&rsquo;ll
give him the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo; Suddenly she began
to laugh. &ldquo;And that isn&rsquo;t all,&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;This
morning a collar arrived for that blessed cat&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She
indicated Charlie sleeping peacefully on the rug. &ldquo;A
silver collar, too my boy, with Esther&rsquo;s name on it....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky stooped to examine the collar; his face was red
when, after a moment, he looked up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther declares she never told him we&rsquo;d got a cat,&rdquo;
June told him doubtfully. &ldquo;But, of course, she must
have done so or else the man&rsquo;s got second sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky was drinking his tea; he choked suddenly.</p>
<p>A feeling of panic closed upon him. Never told him
she&rsquo;d got a cat! of course she hadn&rsquo;t! What a fool he
had been to make such a blunder&ndash;&ndash;what an utter blockhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect she did tell him,&rdquo; he managed to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I think.&rdquo; June lit a cigarette and
passed the lighted match over to Micky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, Esther goes about the place singing all day,&rdquo;
she added drily. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt at all that she&rsquo;s up
in the seventh heaven of happiness. Reams of letters
the man writes her. Perhaps, as the novels tell us, love
is a wonderful thing&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She looked at Micky with a
comical expression in her queer eyes. &ldquo;I should say it
must be if it&rsquo;s reformed that man,&rdquo; she added cynically.</p>
<p>Micky said nothing. He had been very uncomfortable
about things during the last few days. As far as he
could find out, Ashton had not yet been married. Supposing
it had all been bluff when he said he was going to
be married&ndash;&ndash;supposing he turned up again in London?</p>
<p>Micky stayed as long as he could in case Esther came
in; it was only when he began to feel sure that June
knew why he was dragging his visit to such a length that
he said he ought to be going.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hurry,&rdquo; she said kindly. &ldquo;Why not wait
till Esther comes in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky shook his head; he said he couldn&rsquo;t spare the
time, but in his heart he knew quite well that he intended
to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose she&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;she never talks any more about
taking a job now, eh?&rdquo; he asked after a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so; that man&rsquo;s word is law to her,
you know. I believe if he said &lsquo;Come out here and marry
me at once,&rsquo; she&rsquo;d fly off by the next train. As a matter
of fact, I&rsquo;m expecting something of the sort almost daily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; Micky said. He stood
back to the fire, with his hands in his pockets, staring up
at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; June watched him quizzically. &ldquo;Do you know,
Micky,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;that I consider you&rsquo;ve altered
a lot lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swung round at once, and scrutinised himself in
the glass over the mantelshelf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the worse, or the better?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.
&ldquo;I know I never was exactly an Adonis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean your face, stupid, but yourself. You&rsquo;re
quieter, you don&rsquo;t go about so much; in fact&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she challenged
him deliberately&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am,&rdquo; said Micky stolidly.</p>
<p>She pretended not to take him seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no joking matter&ndash;&ndash;I mean what I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Micky. He laughed. He came over
to where she was sitting, and stood behind her chair so
that she could not see his face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to make up
my mind to tell you lots of times,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I
thought perhaps you&rsquo;d have guessed before now....&rdquo;
He stopped and moved away restlessly.</p>
<p>June sat very still; presently&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Esther,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Micky!...&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be sorry for me; I walked into it with
my eyes wide open. I knew she was engaged&ndash;&ndash;I knew
it all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Esther ... does she know? Have you told
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.... She took it as an insult. Perhaps it
was; I don&rsquo;t know. You see, I knew she was engaged
to that other fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An outsider! who isn&rsquo;t worth a thought,&rdquo; June cried
indignantly. &ldquo;Micky, however could she have refused
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed. He looked down at her with a comical
expression in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not the first woman who&rsquo;s done that,&rdquo; he reminded
her.</p>
<p>She sat up with sudden haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t anything, but this....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Micky, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t anything either, except on
my side. You always told me that some day I shouldn&rsquo;t
be able to have what I wanted. You were right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to slap her!&rdquo; said June viciously.</p>
<p>He laughed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you did I should slap you, my dear.&rdquo; He went
back to his chair by the fire. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only between ourselves,
June,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course ... and, Micky&ndash;&ndash;do you think she
will marry Ashton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky did not answer for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&ndash;&ndash;then do you mean&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; But he would not
tell her anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard quite enough for one day,&rdquo; he said
teasingly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry your head about me. I don&rsquo;t
know why I told you&ndash;&ndash;somehow I thought you&rsquo;d
guessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June threw her cigarette into the fire.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I did. I&rsquo;ll be honest&ndash;&ndash;I did guess,&rdquo; she broke off.
&ldquo;Here is Esther,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>She got up and opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady with the fur coat,&rdquo; she announced drily.
&ldquo;Pray come in, madame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;June,&rdquo; said Esther protestingly.</p>
<p>She seemed to guess who was there. She looked past
her friend at once to Micky.</p>
<p>She coloured faintly as he rose to greet her.</p>
<p>He had not seen her in the fur coat before. The dark
fur suited her fairness admirably; the heavy folds hung
gracefully about her slim figure; her face rose like a
flower from the big, upstanding collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where have you been all the afternoon?&rdquo; June
demanded. &ldquo;We waited tea for you till nearly five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther made a little grimace. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my tea out&ndash;&ndash;with
Mr. Harley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harley?&rdquo; said Micky sharply.</p>
<p>June laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of the tribe who live here,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a great admirer of Esther&rsquo;s. And he&rsquo;s quite a
nice boy too, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; she appealed to her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nice,&rdquo; Esther agreed. &ldquo;I met him quite by
chance, and so we went and had some tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky was frowning; it was odd that he felt more
jealous of this man whom he had never seen than he
had ever done of Ashton. He hated to feel that Esther
had gone out with him wearing her new coat.</p>
<p>He stood by silently while the two girls chattered
together; he felt very much out of it and unwanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad everybody likes my coat,&rdquo; Esther said. She
had taken it off and was holding it at arm&rsquo;s length,
admiring its beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a lovely present, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; She appealed
to Micky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She laid her cheek to the big, soft collar.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something I have wanted all my life,&rdquo; she told
him.</p>
<p>Micky put out his hand and took it from her. He
hated to see her standing there looking so happy because
she believed it had come from Ashton; he threw it
down on the couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to be going,&rdquo; he said abruptly. He shook
hands with June, but he walked out of the room without
speaking to Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any dinner,&rdquo; he told Driver when he
got in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driver opened his mouth to say something and closed
it again; he brought the evening papers and his master&rsquo;s
slippers and turned to leave the room. At the door he
stopped and looked back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen the evening paper, sir?&rdquo; he asked
deprecatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Micky. Something in the man&rsquo;s voice arrested
his attention; he turned in his chair. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
he asked curtly.</p>
<p>Driver came back a step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a notice of Mr. Ashton&rsquo;s marriage in it, that&rsquo;s
all, sir,&rdquo; he said woodenly. &ldquo;I thought that you&rsquo;d be
interested.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>
<p>So it had come at last. Micky sat staring down at
the small paragraph which briefly announced the
marriage of Tubby Clare&rsquo;s wealthy widow to Mr.
Raymond Ashton.</p>
<p>The ceremony, so the paper declared, which had taken
place quietly in Paris would be a complete surprise to
everybody. Mrs. Clare, as all the world knew, inherited
something like &pound;90,000 under the will of her late husband.</p>
<p>Micky whistled softly. Raymond had done well for
himself. He would be able to live in luxury for the
rest of his life; to discharge all his debts, if his wife
chose to allow him to do so; all but one debt&ndash;&ndash;the greatest
of them all, and one which he could never hope to
liquidate&ndash;&ndash;a woman&rsquo;s broken heart.</p>
<p>Esther&ndash;&ndash;what would she say if she knew? And supposing
she knew now&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;! It was quite likely that a copy
of this same paper had fallen into her hands. The
thought turned Micky cold; he looked up hurriedly at the
clock&ndash;&ndash;not yet eight! On what pretext could he go back
to Elphinstone Road?</p>
<p>He threw the paper down and rose to his feet. His
gloves! He would make them the excuse&ndash;&ndash;he could go
back for his gloves. He taxied down the whole way;
he sent his name up to June and waited in the hall.
After a moment she came flying down the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky! Is anything the matter? What in the
world....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He explained in stammering haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen the evening paper? No, well, take
care not to let Miss Shepstone see it. I had to come
back and tell you. Ashton&ndash;&ndash;the damned outsider....&rdquo;
He ground his teeth.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Not dead!&rdquo; said June with a gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;he was married yesterday in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June sat down on the bottom stair; she felt as if all
the strength had gone out of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be true,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;Why, she had
a letter from him only yesterday. Are you sure? It
must be another Ashton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;I knew it was coming. He&rsquo;s married Tubby
Clare&rsquo;s widow&ndash;&ndash;for her money, of course. If Esther
knows....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will break her heart,&rdquo; said June.</p>
<p>There were footsteps on the landing above; Micky
glanced up hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we go somewhere and talk? Everybody will
hear if we stay here. Where is Miss Shepstone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in my room; she&rsquo;s writing to him at this
minute&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She broke off, drawing in her breath hard.
&ldquo;Oh, Micky, are you quite, quite sure? I can&rsquo;t believe
it.&rdquo; She stared at him for a moment, then she laughed
incredulously. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s only three days ago he sent
her that fur coat&ndash;&ndash;and the collar for Charlie. Oh, I&rsquo;m
sure it&rsquo;s a mistake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a mistake,&rdquo; said Micky fiercely; he looked
away from her. &ldquo;Confound it, isn&rsquo;t there a room where
we can go and talk?&rdquo; he broke out again.</p>
<p>She got up from the stairs and led the way across
the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the drawing-room. Nobody uses it now because
it&rsquo;s so cold.&rdquo; She opened the door and peeped
in. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky followed her, shutting the door behind him.
The room was chilly and uninviting, with a lofty ceiling
and a hideous wallpaper. There was a gas stove at the
far end of the room, turned very low, and hissing softly
as if in protest.</p>
<p>June knelt down and turned the tap on to its fullest
extent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing is,&rdquo; Micky said hurriedly, &ldquo;what are we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
going to do? If she stays in London, she&rsquo;s bound to
hear about it. All the papers will be full of it to-morrow.
They&rsquo;ll probably publish his confounded portrait. Can&rsquo;t
you get her out of London? We&rsquo;ve got to do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June did not look at him. The odd little twinge of
jealousy tore her heart again. Even though she did not
love Micky, she quite realised what she was losing. After
all it must be a very beautiful thing to be cared for as
Micky cared for Esther.</p>
<p>She raised her eyes with a little ghost of a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything I can, Micky. If you&rsquo;ve got anything
to suggest&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought out crowds of plans coming along in the
cab, but they&rsquo;re all rotten,&rdquo; Micky admitted dolefully.
&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d be able to help me. Can&rsquo;t you be
called off to a relative in the country or something, and
ask Miss Shepstone to go with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>June started up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I can. I&rsquo;ve got an aunt down at Enmore.
She&rsquo;s always asking me to go and see her. I&rsquo;ll send
her a wire. It&rsquo;s too late to-night, but in the morning....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky felt in his pocket for a pencil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the address and I&rsquo;ll send it first thing.&rdquo; He
paused. &ldquo;Supposing Miss Shepstone won&rsquo;t go, though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said June quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell her it
means business for me. I&rsquo;ll do the pathetic. I wonder
what time there&rsquo;s a train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look up all the trains, and arrange everything.
Does Miss Shepstone know I&rsquo;m here now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, tell her one of your business agents called,
and that you&rsquo;ve got to go off early to-morrow. You
can write me a note and post it to-night, asking me to
see you off. It&rsquo;s quite a usual thing for you to do, you
know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>June smiled rather sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Micky!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Micky frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk rubbish,&rdquo; he said rather shortly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
do the same for any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June knew it would be useless to contradict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can keep her out of town for a week it may
all have blown over,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run down and
see you if I may&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you may; but, Micky&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t you think all
this is rather mistaken kindness? She&rsquo;ll have to know
sooner or later; why not tell her at once? When the
letters stop coming she&rsquo;ll begin to worry, and then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky shook his head obstinately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve my own reasons; be a pal and help me, June.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, old boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re making a mistake, but I suppose you
know your own business best. At any rate, I&rsquo;ve warned
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear,&rdquo; said Micky gratefully.</p>
<p>June went to the front door with him; in spite of her
promise she was not feeling happy. Esther would have
to know. She went slowly back up the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mistake,&rdquo; she told herself again, with a sense
of foreboding. &ldquo;Micky&rsquo;s making a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she determined to act up to her part. She ran
up the last flight of stairs with a great noise and show
of excitement. She burst into their sitting-room breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such news, Esther! Are you game for a dash down
into the wilds of nowhere? I&rsquo;ve got to go off on business.
One of my agents has just been here. He&rsquo;s made
a mess of things, as usual, and I&rsquo;ve got to go down and
put things right. Oh, it&rsquo;s quite country! I don&rsquo;t know
if you like the country. I adore it myself. A place
called Enmore. I&rsquo;ve got an antediluvian aunt who lives
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
there, and we&rsquo;ll go and foist ourselves on her. She&rsquo;s
always asking me to go and see her, so she&rsquo;ll be delighted.
Well, what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t given me a chance to say anything,&rdquo;
Esther protested laughing. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like a whirlwind,
sweeping every one off their feet. Where is Enmore
to start with? And how can I go? Your aunt doesn&rsquo;t
know me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll love you because I do,&rdquo; said June promptly.
&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t spoil everything. The greatest fun of it
all is rushing off at a moment&rsquo;s notice. I shall send
Micky a note to-night and tell him to look up trains for
us and come and see us off. Micky&rsquo;s always to be relied
on. If I look trains up myself I always go by the wrong
ones and never get there.&rdquo; She was sitting down to her
desk as she spoke; she looked across at Esther, pen in
hand. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she queried.</p>
<p>Esther looked down at Charlie sprawling in the firelight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going to become of Charlie?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lydia will look after him,&rdquo; June said promptly. &ldquo;She
adores cats. That&rsquo;s one excuse surmounted. Any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to come, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s settled. We&rsquo;ll stay a week if we&rsquo;re not
bored to death. It&rsquo;s a desolate spot&ndash;&ndash;just a handful of
houses and a haystack and a few things like that, but
if you like the country we ought to have a good time.
I wish I&rsquo;d got a car....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it rather a funny place to go to for business?&rdquo;
Esther asked innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; June declared. &ldquo;All the ingredients
for my skin food came from the country&ndash;&ndash;herbs and
attar of flowers and all the rest of it. Besides&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she
swallowed hard before uttering the biggest fib of all&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;my
agent lives down there, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Esther. She was rather pleased at the
idea of a change.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we can have letters sent on?&rdquo; she asked
after a moment.</p>
<p>June&rsquo;s scratching pen stopped for a moment; then
flew on again faster than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course!&rdquo; she said airily.</p>
<p>Her kind heart gave a little throb of pity as she realised
that there would never be any letters to send on&ndash;&ndash;not
any, at least, of which Esther was thinking.</p>
<p>The phantom lover had gone for ever.</p>
<p>She looked round at the girl pityingly. She looked so
happy and unconscious sitting there in the firelight, and
all the time if she knew what had just happened over
in Paris her heart would surely break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beast!&rdquo; said June under her breath.</p>
<p>Esther turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only talking to the pen,&rdquo; June answered irascibly.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Micky turned up at Paddington the following
morning laden with papers and chocolates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one would think we were going to the
other side of the world,&rdquo; June told him. &ldquo;Do you know,
my good man, that it&rsquo;s only a couple of hours&rsquo; run to
Enmore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said Micky guilelessly. &ldquo;Well, any way, I&rsquo;m
sure you won&rsquo;t be able to get De Bry&rsquo;s chocolates down
there, so they&rsquo;ll come in useful.&rdquo; He looked at Esther.
She was wearing the fur coat and a bunch of violets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s awfully exciting,&rdquo; she said, meeting his
eyes. &ldquo;We never thought about going till quite late last
night, did we, June?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things done in a hurry are almost the most enjoyable,&rdquo;
June answered sententiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite bucked
at the idea of living the simple life for a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity you haven&rsquo;t got a car down there,&rdquo; Micky said.
&ldquo;There ought to be some fine runs round about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there are,&rdquo; said June promptly. Her queer eyes
twinkled as she looked at him. &ldquo;Micky, would you like
to be a perfect dear and come down in yours, and take
us out? You can stay at the local inn and play the
heavy swell&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky flushed eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a ripping idea,&rdquo; he said. He turned to Esther:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come like a shot if I shan&rsquo;t be in the way,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Esther smiled; she was surprised to find that the idea
was not at all distasteful to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; do come!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>June had got into the carriage, and was busy arranging
her various possessions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be left behind, Esther,&rdquo; she said warningly.</p>
<p>Esther turned at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Mellowes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky took her hand in a hard grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye&ndash;&ndash;but only till to-morrow....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood back as the train started; the last glimpse
the two girls had of him was his radiantly smiling face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said June, settling herself in a corner,
&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;m half in love with that man, after all. Isn&rsquo;t
he just a dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s awfully kind,&rdquo; Esther agreed.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When the train drew into the little station at Enmore
June looked at Esther with a sort of apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a most awful one-eyed hole, you know,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I do hope you won&rsquo;t be bored to death. It won&rsquo;t be
so bad if Micky keeps his promise and comes down, but
if he doesn&rsquo;t....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he will?&rdquo; Esther asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dare say he will. I hope he will, I&rsquo;m sure;
somebody has got to amuse you while I go and see to
my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can amuse myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June sniffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you? Well, it&rsquo;s more than I could when I used
to stay down here. There&rsquo;s only a church and a village
inn and a handful of cottages. My aunt has by far
the most distinguished-looking house in the village, and
I dare say you won&rsquo;t think much of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were on the platform now, and June eyed their
two suit-cases ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to carry them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No porters
or taxicabs here, my dear. Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She grabbed her own, and Esther followed her out
into the road.</p>
<p>It was cold but sunny, and the fresh air of the country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
was something quite different from the chilly, damp atmosphere
they had left behind in London.</p>
<p>Esther drew a deep breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lovely,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you know&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she looked
ahead of her down the winding road with a little frown&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got the sort of feeling that something is going to
happen to me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; said June. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you start having instincts
too! It&rsquo;s bad enough for me to have them. What
can happen to you, pray, unless you get melancholia or
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther laughed.</p>
<p>It was only a little way into the village; as soon as
they came in sight of it June pointed excitedly to a red
gabled house just visible through the trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where my aunt lives. She&rsquo;s an old maid, you
know, and incidentally she thinks I&rsquo;m a most heaven-born
genius. She&rsquo;s nearly sixty, but I&rsquo;ll bet anything you
like she uses June Mason&rsquo;s Skin Beautifier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused to open the iron gate of the little garden, but
before there was time to ring the bell the door opened
and a little lady with grey hair and a wonderful complexion
very much like June&rsquo;s stood there with outstretched
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dears! I never was so delighted! June&ndash;&ndash;after
all these months you really have come to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kissed June heartily and turned to Esther. June
introduced them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend, Esther Shepstone&ndash;&ndash;my aunt, Miss Dearling.
I don&rsquo;t know what you think of us for arriving
on top of our wire like this,&rdquo; she said, laughing. &ldquo;But
I like to do things in a hurry&ndash;&ndash;so here we are, and we&rsquo;re
just starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed Miss Dearling into a quaint little square
room, where the table was laid for lunch. June talked
away all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another member of the party coming down
to-morrow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No; a man this time&ndash;&ndash;Micky
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
Mellowes! You remember him? Yes; I thought you
would.&rdquo; She flushed a little. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to bring his
car down and take us all out for rides; so we&rsquo;re in for a
good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember Mr. Mellowes quite well,&rdquo; Miss Dearling
said. When she was alone with Esther for a moment
she whispered to her&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all hoped June meant to marry him, you know,
my dear. Perhaps she has changed her mind, as she
is allowing him to come down. Such a very charming
man&ndash;&ndash;have you seen him?&ndash;&ndash;and so rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve seen him,&rdquo; Esther said. &ldquo;He is nice&ndash;&ndash;very!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be the dream of my life fulfilled if I could
see June married to him,&rdquo; the old lady went on. &ldquo;June
wants a firm hand. She is wonderfully high-spirited
and clever, you know, but I always feel that she would
be so much happier with some one to look after her,
and he is just the man to take care of a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Esther.</p>
<p>She felt Miss Dearling glance at her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you&ndash;&ndash;are you engaged to be married?&rdquo; she asked,
after a moment. &ldquo;Please forgive my curiosity, but I am
always so interested in young people&rsquo;s love-affairs....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther coloured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am engaged,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But he is away just
now&ndash;&ndash;abroad. I hope we shall be married as soon as he
comes home again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dearling said that she hoped so, too; later, when
she got a moment alone with June she asked interestedly
about the man to whom Esther was engaged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope he is nice,&rdquo; she said anxiously. &ldquo;Such a
very charming girl! such a sweet-looking girl! Is he
nice, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>June crossed the room and shut the door; then she
turned round with a little grimace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a pig!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Miss Dearling screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; June maintained stoutly. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t think
so, of course, but he is, all the same.&rdquo; She broke off
as Esther came back.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Esther woke in the morning with a pleasurable sense
of something going to happen. She lay still for a moment
looking round her at the heavy, old fashioned furniture
and flowered chintz curtains.</p>
<p>Miss Dearling&rsquo;s house was essentially Early Victorian,
from its wool mats and stuffed birds in the sitting-room
to the high four-posted bedsteads and faded Brussels
carpets.</p>
<p>But there was something very old-world and charming
about it too, in spite of rather ugly furniture, and
Esther was just admiring the dressing-table, with its
petticoat of spotted muslin and pink ribbons, when the
door opened and June thrust her head round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I come in?&rdquo; She did not wait for an answer,
but came in, her long mauve silk kimono making a little
rustling sound as she walked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really dressed,&rdquo; she explained, sitting down on
Esther&rsquo;s bed. &ldquo;All but my frock, at least, and as the
post has just come, and a letter from Micky, I thought
I&rsquo;d come and tell you that he&rsquo;ll be down to-day&ndash;&ndash;after
lunch, and he wants us to meet him. I can&rsquo;t go, as I&rsquo;ve
got a business appointment at three, so you must. He&rsquo;s
going to drive up to the station and wait there for one
of us to come and show him where we live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little silence. Esther flushed beneath the
elder girl&rsquo;s shrewd gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought he could have found out where
we live,&rdquo; she said rather awkwardly. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s such
a little way&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>June rose with a great show of dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, if you don&rsquo;t want to be obliging, but
I do think you might....&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Silly&ndash;&ndash;of course I will.&rdquo; Esther caught her hand.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go; the station at three o&rsquo;clock, and then what am
I to do? Bring him here, or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what you like, my child&ndash;&ndash;I shan&rsquo;t be in till five.
Don&rsquo;t let him be bored, that&rsquo;s all, or he&rsquo;ll go back to
town&ndash;&ndash;the one thing Micky cannot stand is being bored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther made a little grimace.</p>
<p>She felt nervous when at five minutes to three exactly
she walked down the winding road to the station.</p>
<p>June ought to have come herself, she argued; it was
a most silly thing to send her&ndash;&ndash;she hoped he would not
come at all; but all the time she was listening for the
sound of a car or a motor-horn. The sleepy-eyed factotum
of the station walked up and stared at her curiously.
After a few turns he ventured to ask if she
wanted to go by train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m waiting for a gentleman&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;oh, here he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas her young gentleman for sure,&rdquo; the sleepy-eyed
one told his colleague afterwards. &ldquo;She blushed
up like a rose when she saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky noticed that blush, too, as he turned the car
with a fine sweep and came to a standstill.</p>
<p>Esther greeted him with a torrent of explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;June couldn&rsquo;t come, so she made me&ndash;&ndash;she had to go
out on business. She would make me come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind,&rdquo; Micky said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m later than I expected&ndash;&ndash;the
roads are bad down in this part of the world.
Well, and how do you like Enmore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very quiet, but I like it for a change, and June&rsquo;s
aunt is ever so kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a dear old lady; I know her well. Did you tell
her I was coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;June did....&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes swept her face anxiously. No trace of tears
or sadness to-day, at all events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we supposed to go straight home?&rdquo; he asked
after a moment. &ldquo;Because, if not, what do you say to
a run round first?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></div>
<p>Esther&rsquo;s eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should love it!&rdquo; She got in beside him, and the car
started away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only brought the two-seater,&rdquo; Micky explained
audaciously. &ldquo;I hate a crowd. This will take three at
a pinch, but it&rsquo;s much more comfortable for two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lovely!&rdquo; Esther agreed.</p>
<p>She leaned back luxuriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be splendid to be able to have a car like this
of your very own,&rdquo; she said suddenly.</p>
<p>Micky laughed rather ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are other things I would far rather have,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there?&rdquo; She looked up at him innocently. &ldquo;What
things?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Micky&rsquo;s hands tightened over the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I really to answer that question?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Esther hurriedly.</p>
<p>She could not think why she had been so stupid as
to say such a thing. She felt very vexed.</p>
<p>They went some way in silence. Esther glanced at
the man beside her timidly.</p>
<p>Would he end up by some day marrying June? she
wondered. Lucky June, if he did&ndash;&ndash;lucky ... she
checked the thought with a little sense of shame. Only
a few days ago she had declared that she disliked him.
Perhaps it was the car that made her feel so suddenly
envious of the woman who would one day be this man&rsquo;s
wife.</p>
<p>Micky glanced down at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a little&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she smiled up at him&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;in spite of my
new coat,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think we had better go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June came to the door to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got home earlier than I thought,&rdquo; she told Esther.
&ldquo;Well, Micky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any letters?&rdquo; Esther asked. She felt a
swift feeling of envy as she looked at these two, so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
openly and unfeignedly glad to see one another. &ldquo;I suppose
it&rsquo;s expecting too much though,&rdquo; she added with a
sigh.</p>
<p>June did not answer, and Esther went on and up the
stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one for her,&rdquo; June said in an undertone to
Micky as soon as she had gone. &ldquo;And one from Paris,
too&ndash;&ndash;from that man! Micky, are you sure it isn&rsquo;t all a
mistake about him being married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Micky stolidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then shall I&ndash;&ndash;what shall I do about that letter&ndash;&ndash;it
was sent on from London. Ought I to let her have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky was taking off his coat, his back was turned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let her have it,&rdquo; he said casually. &ldquo;It may be
the last she&rsquo;ll ever get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned swiftly. &ldquo;Let me look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June took it from her dress and handed it to him.</p>
<p>He glanced at the writing and gave it back to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I should let her have it,&rdquo; he said again.</p>
<p>But June still hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky&ndash;&ndash;supposing it&rsquo;s to tell her about&ndash;&ndash;you know
... about this marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it would hardly be that,&rdquo; Micky said positively.
&ldquo;At least&ndash;&ndash;well, if it is, we must chance it.&rdquo; But his
voice did not sound as if he were at all anxious.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>
<p>June raked up another appointment for the following
day. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m behaving like an angel to you,&rdquo; she
told Micky. &ldquo;Yesterday I tramped about the fields
till I was worn out so that I should be out of the way
and Esther could meet you. Oh, she didn&rsquo;t want to go
at all,&rdquo; she hastened to add as she saw the look of pleasure
that filled his eyes. &ldquo;I had to make her go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I quite believe that,&rdquo; Micky said.</p>
<p>He was standing beside the car at Miss Dearling&rsquo;s
gate, and Esther was upstairs putting on her hat. She
had protested twenty times that she did not really want
to go; she had begged June to take her place; she had
implored Micky to take June instead; but they had both
refused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not keen on motoring when it&rsquo;s cold,&rdquo; June declared.
&ldquo;Besides, I&rsquo;ve got my business to see to, and
I don&rsquo;t want Micky. You go, Esther, and amuse the
poor soul!&ndash;&ndash;just to please me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther said &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and tried to look as if she
were not anxious at all, but she was really looking forward
to another drive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you really want to come?&rdquo; Micky asked as
they drove away.</p>
<p>Esther laughed. &ldquo;Of course I did; I wanted to come
so badly I had to pretend that I didn&rsquo;t just for decency&rsquo;s
sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have good news from Paris yesterday?&rdquo; he
asked deliberately.</p>
<p>He felt as if he must speak of Ashton to in some way
check the wave of joy that had filled his heart at her
words; it was not to be with him that she had wished
to come, but for the drive and the comfort of the car.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<p>He saw how her face clouded at his question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you,&rdquo; she said, but her voice did not sound
very enthusiastic. Presently: &ldquo;Mr. Mellowes,&rdquo; she said
suddenly, &ldquo;do you know that I have always been sorry
that I did not go to Paris that day when I wanted to?&ndash;&ndash;I
wish I had now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why now?&rdquo; Micky asked.</p>
<p>She gave a little troubled laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I really can&rsquo;t explain.&rdquo; She did not
understand herself what she really meant, but last night
when she had read Raymond&rsquo;s letter, it had suddenly
come over her with a sickening feeling of dismay that in
some indefinite way he was really getting to be what
June had always called him&ndash;&ndash;a phantom lover! It seemed
so long since she had seen him. After all, what were
letters and words? But she could not explain this to
Micky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know what you mean,&rdquo; he said after a
moment. &ldquo;You are getting tired of this separation. Is
that it? Letters are all very well, but they are not
enough....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at him in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that is just what I do mean? How did you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed rather ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ve felt like it myself,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; There was a little note of wonderment
in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said &lsquo;perhaps,&rsquo;&rdquo; he reminded her.</p>
<p>She changed the subject; she drew his attention to the
country through which they were passing. It was bare
and wind-swept, but there was a sort of rugged picturesqueness
about it that appealed to Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I should like to live in the country, after
all,&rdquo; she said suddenly. &ldquo;You seem to be able to really
breathe down here; it&rsquo;s not shut in like London is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old London,&rdquo; Micky said. &ldquo;We all run it down,
but we&rsquo;re all glad to get back there when we&rsquo;ve been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
away for more than a few days.&rdquo; He leaned forward,
wrapping the rug more closely round her. &ldquo;Where do
you think you will live when you are married?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The hot colour flooded her face; she looked up at him
in a scared sort of way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a question! How do I know? I&rsquo;ve never
even thought about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Micky. &ldquo;I have, crowds of times.
I&rsquo;ve worked it all out to a nicety. I shall have a house
in London and a place in the country as well, so that
if my wife doesn&rsquo;t like town we can divide our time
and stay six months at each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not all rich like you are, you know,&rdquo; Esther
said drily. &ldquo;I dare say when I get married&ndash;&ndash;if I ever
do&ndash;&ndash;I shall just have a little flat somewhere and stay
there for the rest of my life, and be very happy too,&rdquo;
she added with a sort of defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Micky after a moment. &ldquo;I think I could
be very happy in a flat, too, for the rest of my life&ndash;&ndash;with
the right woman.&rdquo; He looked down at her, smiling
thoughtfully &ldquo;The only trouble is, that I shall probably
have to marry the wrong one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do, it will be your own fault, I should think,&rdquo;
said Esther, laughing. She could not quite understand
this man. Had he ever really loved her, or had it all
just been a pretence?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Micky promptly. &ldquo;I think it will be your
fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther raised her eyes slowly. Micky was smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I mean it,&rdquo; he said seriously. &ldquo;The first time
I ever saw you I thought to myself, &lsquo;Here she is! That
right woman I&rsquo;ve been waiting for all my life&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;but, of
course, you didn&rsquo;t think I was the right man, and so
that ended it,&rdquo; he added philosophically.</p>
<p>Esther did not like to hear him speak so lightly. She
would have been surprised if she could have known the
desperate unhappiness in his heart, the bitterness that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
drove him to speak so flippantly of all that he held best
and dearest.</p>
<p>She made no attempt to answer him, and presently
he said again with change of voice&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hungry, I wonder? Because I am! And
I&rsquo;ve got a firm conviction that we&rsquo;re coming to a wayside
inn. Do you see the chimneys through the
trees?...&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slowed the car a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another car outside&ndash;&ndash;what do you say? Shall
we risk it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be rather nice,&rdquo; Esther admitted. She was
feeling cold; she was rather glad when the car stopped
and Micky gave her his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a fire anyway,&rdquo; he said cheerily. &ldquo;I
saw it through the window, and we&rsquo;ll ask for some
coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way into the parlour. Two men wrapped
in heavy coats stood by the fire; they moved to make
way for Esther. After a moment they went out of the
room, and she saw them in the road bending over the
car next to Micky&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can have coffee and buns,&rdquo; Micky said, coming
back after a moment. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;ll be
like, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall enjoy them anyway,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;I really
am hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled off his gloves and dragged a chair up to
the fire for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is fine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have you ever thought what
a novelty a honeymoon would be touring through villages
like this? I should like to just start away and go on
driving for miles and miles, just staying anywhere and
getting meals anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther laughed. &ldquo;I should have thought it was just
the sort of thing you would hate,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re mistaken,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I live
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
in town and in the way I do because people expect it
of me, and I&rsquo;m too lazy to bother to change. It&rsquo;s not
a bit the life I should choose if I had my way. I hate
dressing for dinner, and wading through six or seven
courses, and being bored stiff half the time by some
dressed-up woman beside me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her with a comical expression.</p>
<p>Esther leaned her chin in her hand and raised serious
eyes to his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how would you really like to live, then?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>Micky sat down on the edge of the table and stuck
his long legs out before him. He kept his eyes fixed
on his boots as he answered&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should like a place in the country, as I said,
and a garden&ndash;&ndash;a ripping garden, with lots of roses and
grass&ndash;&ndash;walks like you see in old-fashioned pictures,
and a high box hedge&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s one of the things I simply
must have! Have you ever smelt a box hedge after
a hot sun has been on it? No? well, you ought to;
it&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to look after the roses myself, I think,&rdquo;
he went on presently. &ldquo;I dare say I should make a mess
of it, but I should like to have a try, anyway. And I
should like to keep lots of animals, horses and dogs and
chickens. Do you know&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he half turned to her&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
always had a fancy for great Danes&ndash;&ndash;you can&rsquo;t keep
&rsquo;em in town, only in the country. Some people I once
stayed with down in Lincoln had a couple&ndash;&ndash;ripping dogs
they were&ndash;&ndash;almost as big as ponies, and they used to let
the kids play with them and pull them about. Old Lancing
had a boy, you know&ndash;&ndash;a ripping little kid of five&ndash;&ndash;a
real sport he was, too&ndash;&ndash;Uncle Micky he used to call me.&rdquo;
Micky chuckled reminiscently. &ldquo;It must be jolly fine to
have a youngster of your own like that,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>This was a new Micky, indeed! Esther watched him
with fascinated eyes. She had not known that he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
fond of children; she had taken it for granted that men
hardly ever were. She supposed drearily that she had
got that idea from Raymond. He had always said he
would not stand &ldquo;kids.&rdquo; It was odd that, though Micky
had used the same word, it had sounded somehow quite
different when he said it.</p>
<p>Micky raised his eyes suddenly. &ldquo;What are you thinking
about?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head; her lip quivered a little.</p>
<p>Micky half rose to go to her, when the two men who
owned the second car came back into the room again.
Micky turned on his heel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we ought to be getting on,&rdquo; he said constrainedly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and start up; you stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went out, leaving Esther by the fire.</p>
<p>Her thoughts were a little confused. What had he
been going to say, she wondered. It seemed hardly
possible that she had really had that little glimpse of the
other Micky whom she had never seen before; the Micky
who was not at all a man about town, but just an ordinary
person who thought it must be fine to have a
home in the country and lots of roses and a little son
of his own.</p>
<p>The two men behind her were talking together; one
of them was laughing a good deal in a sneering way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be a fool, you know,&rdquo; he said drily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
surprised at any woman being caught like that. It was
only her money he was after, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen her myself,&rdquo; the other said disinterestedly&ndash;&ndash;he
sounded rather bored&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and I only know him
slightly. You met them in Paris, you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;last week.&rdquo; There was the sound of a match
being struck and a little pause while he puffed at a
cigarette.</p>
<p>Esther turned in her chair; it was odd how the mention
of Paris always seemed to grip her heart. She
looked at the two men, but they were both strangers
to her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he won&rsquo;t really marry her,&rdquo; the elder one
said yawning. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s many a slip you know, and
from what I know of Raymond Ashton&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He
shrugged his shoulders eloquently.</p>
<p>The girl by the fire sat very still. She was staring
at the two men with piteous grey eyes; she felt as if all
the blood in her body had ebbed to her heart, where
it was hammering enough to kill her.</p>
<p>Like some one in a dream she heard the laugh the
other man gave&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not marry her! My dear boy, he must! It&rsquo;s his
last chance, and he knows it! He&rsquo;s up to his neck in
debt and borrowed money. As a matter of fact, I
shouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised if Tubby Clare&rsquo;s little widow
hasn&rsquo;t already changed her name for Raymond Ashton&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>
<p>Outside in the road Micky suddenly started up
the engine of his car. The dull throb, throb, came
faintly to Esther as she sat there as motionless
as if she had been carved in stone.</p>
<p>The little vibrant noise sounded like the beating of
some one&rsquo;s heart, she thought dully; she found herself
listening to it subconsciously.</p>
<p>The two men behind her had moved out to the doorway;
she could still hear them talking and laughing together.
Something within her urged her to get up and
follow them to tell them that she had heard what they
said, to tell them that it was all a lie&ndash;&ndash;a shameful lie.
But she could not move.</p>
<p>She told herself that if she kept quite still for a few
moments she would wake and find that she had just
dreamed it all. She stared hard into the glowing fire,
trying to believe that it was all part of her dream, that
it was not real warmth which she felt on her face at
all, that those leaping flames were only pictures of her
imagination, that even if she thrust her hand into them
they would not burn her, but would just melt away
into the silence around like phantoms.</p>
<p>The phantom lover! June&rsquo;s half-mocking words beat
dully against her brain. June had always hated Raymond;
she would be glad if this thing were true.</p>
<p>She suddenly realised that she was shivering in every
limb. With an effort she dragged her chair closer to
the fire. She put out her hands to the flames....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! what are you doing?&rdquo; said Micky&rsquo;s
voice at her shoulder. She had not heard him come into
the room; it was only when he bent and caught her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
hand back from the flames that she realised what she
had been going to do. She looked up at him with a
sick smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t burn,&rdquo; she said stupidly.</p>
<p>A flash of alarm crept into his eyes; she looked so
white.</p>
<p>He kept her hand in his holding it firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked gently.</p>
<p>There was something so kind in his voice that for a
moment she felt as if she would have given her soul
to have been able to lean her head against his shoulder
and sob out the truth; all she had just heard and all
the miserable hope and fear that had tortured her for
the past few weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Micky said again anxiously.</p>
<p>She dragged her hand free of his; she remembered
that he, too, had hated Raymond, that he, too, would
be glad when he knew of this nightmare that had suddenly
swooped down upon her.</p>
<p>She rose to her feet, holding fast to the chair-back
to steady herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t anything the matter; but I should like
to go home&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m tired, that&rsquo;s all; I&rsquo;m only tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved away to the door. The cold air beating on
her face gave her a grip of herself again. She stood for
a moment looking down the deserted street, her hands
clenched.</p>
<p>It was only for a little while, just until they got back
to Enmore, that she had got to keep up appearances, and
then&ndash;&ndash;then....</p>
<p>A sudden wave of tragedy swept through her soul;
oh, it could not be true! It was some other man of
whom they had been speaking, some other Raymond!</p>
<p>She heard Micky laughing with the landlady as he paid
for the coffee and buns, and she felt that she hated him
for not guessing how she suffered. She walked down
to where the little car stood waiting. If only he would
be quick and take her back; she could do nothing till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
she got back to Enmore, and each moment was so
precious.</p>
<p>It seemed an eternity until Micky joined her. He
avoided looking at her, though he bent and wrapped the
rug carefully over her knees before he took his seat.</p>
<p>The other car with its two occupants had vanished
down the road some minutes since; only a small cloud
of grey dust on the horizon showed which way they
had gone.</p>
<p>Micky drove back faster than he had come. Once or
twice he looked down at Esther with an anxious pucker
between his eyes.</p>
<p>What had happened in those few minutes to make this
sudden change? he wondered.</p>
<p>She had been happy and smiling enough this morning;
now all that he could see of her face, half hidden
in the big upstand collar of the coat he had given her,
were two piteous blue eyes staring steadily ahead of
her down the road.</p>
<p>They had gone some miles almost silently when he
felt that he could bear it no longer. He stopped the
car almost savagely and turned in his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What have I done now?&rdquo; he
asked roughly. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t like this when we came
out. If I&rsquo;ve done anything to annoy you....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She forced herself to laugh. It would be the last
straw if she broke down now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How absurd!&rdquo; she said in a high-pitched voice.
&ldquo;Nothing is the matter. I&rsquo;m tired, that&rsquo;s all; I shall be
glad to get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not telling me the truth,&rdquo; he said. His mind
searched anxiously back to the short time they had
stayed in the inn. What could have happened? They
had seen nobody there except the two men with the racing
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those two fellows who came in&ndash;&ndash;they didn&rsquo;t annoy
you, or anything like that, when I was out of the room?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></div>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not; they never spoke to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t tell me what I&rsquo;ve done, how can I hope
to put things right?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>It was always like this, he told himself savagely; one
little step onward and a dozen back. He did not speak
again till they got home.</p>
<p>Esther got out of the car without waiting for him,
and went on into the house.</p>
<p>After a moment Micky followed.</p>
<p>Esther was in the hall; she turned to him impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one is out,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Miss Dearling and
June are both out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sort of strain in her voice which Micky
could not understand. She looked as if she had had
some bad shock, and yet what could have happened?
He had not left her for more than a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I won&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; he said formally. He spoke
curtly; he felt sore enough; he raised his hat stiffly and
turned away.</p>
<p>He looked back once at the little house. He thought
perhaps Esther might be standing at the door in case he
should turn, but the door was shut, and it was impossible
for him to guess that upstairs in the room over the
porch Esther had shut and locked the door and was
pacing up and down the room, her hands pressed hard
against her eyes, sobbing&ndash;&ndash;great tearless sobs that seemed
to rend her very heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; she said over and over
again under her breath. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s not
true....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The striking of a church clock in the village seemed
to rouse her. June would be back soon, and Miss Dearling.</p>
<p>She dabbed her eyes with her handkerchief; they felt
hot and burning. She looked at herself anxiously in the
little mirror&ndash;&ndash;such a white face; she turned away impatiently.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>Twelve o&rsquo;clock; there was a train up to town at half-past,
she knew. The confusion in her brain seemed to
have passed all at once; she felt quite calm and clear.</p>
<p>She would go to Paris&ndash;&ndash;she would see Raymond, and
hear from his own lips what a lie it was. She ought to
have gone before. She had been a fool to listen to
Micky; of course he would not wish her to go.</p>
<p>She put a few things into a bag. She took the last
letter she had had from Raymond, and kissed it before
thrusting it back into her dress; she scribbled a pencil
note to June and fastened it to the pincushion.</p>
<p>With the little suit-case in her hand she went downstairs
and out into the street.</p>
<p>There was nobody about, and she almost ran to the
station. The porter who had witnessed her meeting yesterday
with Micky stared at her wonderingly.</p>
<p>The London train was due now, he told her. She&rsquo;d
have to hurry.... She was gone before he finished
his slow speech.</p>
<p>She found an empty carriage and got in, sitting as far
away from the door as possible in case any one should
come along the platform and recognize her. It was only
when the train started away that she leaned back and
closed her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to Paris; I can&rsquo;t live without him any
longer. Please don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; Over and over she found
herself repeating these words in her brain. She wondered
where she had heard them and what they really
meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to Paris; I can&rsquo;t live without him any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were true anyway. She was going to Paris because
she felt she could no longer live without Raymond.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes with a little gasp; they were her
own words. She remembered that she had written them
in the note she had left on the pincushion for June.</p>
<p>Poor June! She would be angry. And Micky....
A little throb touched her heart. She had not been very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
kind to Micky. She hoped he would soon forget her.
Her eyes closed again.</p>
<p>How long did it take to get to Paris? She had not
the least idea. She had not got much money with her;
she tried to remember how much, but somehow her
brain refused to act; she took out her purse and tipped
its contents into her lap. She started to count it, but
after a moment she gave it up with a helpless feeling and
put it all back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tubby Clare&rsquo;s little widow....&rdquo; Who was Tubby
Clare? she wondered. She laughed foolishly. What a
name!</p>
<p>But he had left his widow a great deal of money, and
money was everything nowadays. Nobody could be
happy without money; Raymond had told her that months
ago; a man with money has the whole world at his feet,
so he had said.</p>
<p>She thought of Micky&ndash;&ndash;he was one of the richest men
in London, and yet he was not happy. She had never
thought that he looked happy; she wondered if it was
really because he loved her.</p>
<p>She wished she could stop thinking. She was so tired,
she wanted to sleep; but the wheel of thought went on
and on in her brain.</p>
<p>The miles seemed to crawl by. Soon the fields and
open country were left behind; the houses were closer
together; presently they crowded one another, almost
jostling each other out of the way, it seemed.</p>
<p>What an ugly place London was. She sat up with a
little shiver. Strange how cold she felt, and yet her head
was burning hot.</p>
<p>Would this journey never end? Surely they had been
travelling for days and days already.</p>
<p>The train stopped with a jerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paddington ... all change&ndash;&ndash;all change....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther stumbled to her feet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>
<p>Micky had just reached the unpretentious inn in
the village where he had taken a room, when he
was hailed from across the road by June; a very
cheerful looking June, in a business-like coat and skirt
of rough tweed, and carrying a walking-stick, which she
proceeded to wave at him vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back so soon!&rdquo; She came across to where he stood
by the car, and looked at his despondent face. &ldquo;Not another
row?&rdquo; she demanded tersely.</p>
<p>Micky frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;merely a sort of frigid silence this time,&rdquo; he
said savagely, then he laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, June, I
may as well throw up the sponge. I seem to put my
foot in it whatever I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June drew a pattern in the mud at her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what have you done?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Esther was
all right this morning, and quite pleased to be going with
you. I certainly never expected to see either of you
till this afternoon. Where did you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, some little one-eyed place. We stopped at an inn
and had some coffee, and that seemed to finish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, the coffee?&rdquo; asked June with a twinkle.</p>
<p>Micky turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to make a joke of everything&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he
said with dignity.</p>
<p>She laid her hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, old boy. But you do explain things so
badly, you know. You had coffee at the inn, yes&ndash;&ndash;and
then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went outside to start up the engine, and when I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
came back she seemed to have utterly changed. She even
looked different and she hardly spoke all the way home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be your imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t; and when we got home she went indoors
without even saying good-bye&ndash;&ndash;confound her!&rdquo; he added
in savage parenthesis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Micky!&rdquo; said June reproachfully.</p>
<p>He coloured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that, but I&rsquo;m so fed-up with everything&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
He leaned his elbow on the side of the car
and looked away from her down the road. &ldquo;I think
I&rsquo;ll get back to town this afternoon,&rdquo; he said after a
moment. &ldquo;I was a fool to come at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June looked at him silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you thinking?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>She roused herself and answered briskly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you want your lunch, that&rsquo;s what I think,
and I&rsquo;m going to take you back with me to have some.
Aunt Mary is expecting you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Her queer eyes
twinkled. &ldquo;Micky, she&rsquo;s quite made up her mind that
you&rsquo;ve come down here after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky laughed ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a dashed sight better for me if I had,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>He moved to the door of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump in, and I&rsquo;ll drive you back. I&rsquo;m not sure that
I shall stay to lunch, though&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he added darkly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you will,&rdquo; June said. &ldquo;And when you see
Esther you&rsquo;ll find that it was just imagination on your
part&ndash;&ndash;why, only coming down in the train the other
morning she agreed with me that you were a perfect
darling&ndash;&ndash;she did, on my word of honour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached the house Micky meekly followed
June into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The table&rsquo;s laid,&rdquo; she informed him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just go
and take off my hat and find Esther and Aunt Mary.
Go in, Micky.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></div>
<p>Micky took off his hat and coat and obeyed.</p>
<p>He looked several sizes too large for the little dining-room
as he walked over to the fire and stood with his
back to it; he looked round the room appreciatively.</p>
<p>This was a real home, he thought with sudden wistfulness
in spite of its small rooms and general atmosphere
of a bygone decade; a man could be very happy
here with a woman he cared for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky&ndash;&ndash;Micky&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; called June urgently. She came
clattering down the stairs anyhow&ndash;&ndash;she burst into the
room, she thrust a scrap of paper into his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s gone! Oh, what fools we&rsquo;ve been!
I told you what it would be. I knew she&rsquo;d find out
sooner or later. Oh, why didn&rsquo;t you let me tell her?&ndash;&ndash;I
begged you to let me. It&rsquo;s not my fault. I warned you
what it would be&ndash;&ndash;oh dear! oh dear!&rdquo; and June fell into
a sobbing heap on the uncomfortable horsehair couch
behind her.</p>
<p>Micky stood clutching the paper and staring at her; it
was some minutes before he could find his voice, then
he went over to where she lay, put his hand on her
shoulder, and shook her almost roughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, June? For heaven&rsquo;s
sake sit up and behave like a rational woman. Who&rsquo;s
gone? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised her tear-stained face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it! read it! Oh, Micky, you have been a fool!&rdquo;
she said furiously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all your fault. I knew what
would happen&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for heaven&rsquo;s sake shut up,&rdquo; said Micky.</p>
<p>He had unfolded the paper, and there was a moment&rsquo;s
tragic silence as he read the three lines Esther had scribbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have gone to Paris; I can&rsquo;t live without him any
longer. Please don&rsquo;t worry about me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twice his lips moved, but no words would come, then
he broke out in a strangled voice&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a joke&ndash;&ndash;of course it is. She&rsquo;s done it to frighten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
us. Why, I&ndash;&ndash;I only left her here half-an-hour ago&ndash;&ndash;it
can&rsquo;t be more. It&rsquo;s a joke&ndash;&ndash;of&ndash;&ndash;of course it is ...
June....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A queer sort of joke,&rdquo; said June sobbing. &ldquo;Poor
darling! and a nice sort of reception she&rsquo;ll get when she
reaches Paris with that cad there....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll never find him; she doesn&rsquo;t know where he
is,&rdquo; Micky said hoarsely. There was a stunned look in
his eyes&ndash;&ndash;he took a step towards the door and came back
again as if he did not know what to do.</p>
<p>June was drying her eyes and shedding more tears
and drying them again; she looked at Micky angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;ll find him,&rdquo; she said tartly. &ldquo;She
knows his address; the brute&rsquo;s written to her dozens of
times, and she&rsquo;s written to him as well....&rdquo; Her
eyes searched his face with a sort of contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you going to do now you&rsquo;ve made
such a glorious hash of everything?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>Micky passed a hand across his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m trying to think. She can&rsquo;t have
been gone long. She may still be in the village.&rdquo; He
dragged out his watch. &ldquo;There may not have been a
train up to London&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there was; the twelve-twenty&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; The eyes
of both of them turned to the clock, and Micky gave a
smothered groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have gone by that. I must follow her,
of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June bounced up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you; I&rsquo;ll put on my hat again&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
She made a dive for the door, but Micky caught her
arm and stopped her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t; I can&rsquo;t take you with me. Be sensible,
June&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll find her and bring her back&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at him stormily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my friend, and it&rsquo;s all your fault she&rsquo;s got into
this mess. I told you not to interfere, and you wouldn&rsquo;t
listen&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></div>
<p>It was a woman all over to rave at him now, but
Micky took it patiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, it&rsquo;s my fault, and as it&rsquo;s my fault it&rsquo;s up
to me to try and put things right. Don&rsquo;t waste time
arguing&ndash;&ndash;if I&rsquo;m to catch her before she leaves
England....&rdquo;</p>
<p>June burst into fresh tears and sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be able to; she&rsquo;ll get over there and have
to bear it all alone.... Oh, Micky, I almost hate
you when I think what we&rsquo;ve done....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky went out of the room; he went down to the
road and mechanically started up the car; he was getting
into his seat when June followed and called to him&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got your coat or cap, Micky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came back; he hoisted himself into his coat, and
turned away again; June caught his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be a beast, Micky&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave her fingers a squeeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know; it&rsquo;s all right; but don&rsquo;t keep me, there&rsquo;s a
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she still clung to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll bring her back safely, Micky&ndash;&ndash;promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky turned away without answering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... I can&rsquo;t live without him any longer....&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of everything, that was how she still felt about
the brute.</p>
<p>When he got to the station he found there was no
train to town for a couple of hours; he asked a sleepy
porter an agitated question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see a young lady go by the twelve-twenty&ndash;&ndash;one
of the young ladies staying with Miss Dearling. Oh,
for heaven&rsquo;s sake hurry up and answer, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man scratched an unshaven chin with irritating
consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I seen her,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;She came in running&ndash;&ndash;caught
the train to London&ndash;&ndash;she....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Micky had gone; he would have to drive to town,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
he decided. If Esther had got to know the truth, better
hear it from him than from that brute.</p>
<p>He drove off at breakneck speed. It seemed miles and
miles to London; no matter how much of the winding
road he covered, it unfolded again before his eyes, and
mercilessly again.</p>
<p>He went straight to Charing Cross; he left the car in
the yard and dashed in to inquire about trains; he
searched a time-table; 12.59&ndash;&ndash;3 o&rsquo;clock&ndash;&ndash;4.5 ... he
looked up at the clock&ndash;&ndash;three minutes past four now.
Micky dashed across the big hall to a gate where a signboard
said &ldquo;Dover Express&rdquo;; he had no ticket; he pushed
by the protesting inspector; the guard was waving his
flag; some one grabbed at Micky and missed as he flung
himself breathless and panting into the last coach of
the moving train.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>
<p>Micky sat for a few moments breathless and exhausted
before he pulled himself together, and
taking off his hat wiped his hot forehead.</p>
<p>The train was gathering speed; he let down the window
with a run and looked out; the station was out of
sight altogether; they were crossing the bridge under
which the silent Thames flowed sluggishly.</p>
<p>A breath of cold air touched his hot face and he
shivered suddenly and drew the window up once more.</p>
<p>Something had driven his thoughts back to his first
meeting with Esther, to the cold silence of the night,
and the hard desperation of her voice as she said&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to go home any more&ndash;&ndash;I shouldn&rsquo;t
have ever gone home again if I hadn&rsquo;t met you....&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she got to Paris before he saw her she would feel
like this again. Micky groaned.</p>
<p>Fortunately he had the carriage to himself, but it
was a third-class compartment, and not a corridor carriage.
He cursed his luck here; if there had been a
corridor he could have gone the length of the train and
seen if Esther were on it. As it was, he would have to
wait till they reached Dover, and even then perhaps he
would never find her.</p>
<p>He tried to calm himself with the conviction that everything
would be all right, but in his heart he was despairing;
if he found Esther and brought her back she would
hate him for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>What had happened to make her rush off like this?
He could not imagine. She had seemed so happy only
that morning. What could account for the tragedy that
seemed to breathe in every word of that little note she
had left for June?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>He took it from his pocket and read it again. It
gave no hint of what had prompted this sudden flight.
He wrote out a couple of telegrams to dispatch from
Dover&ndash;&ndash;one for June, and another for Driver.</p>
<p>He wished he had got Driver with him. There was
a sort of security in the man&rsquo;s stolidness.</p>
<p>He realised that he was without luggage, and that he
had not much money. Supposing he had to go on to
Paris, what the dickens was he going to do?</p>
<p>When the train ran into Dover he got to his feet with
a sigh of relief. Quickly as he was out of the train a
great many passengers had left it before him. He started
at a run down the platform. He stared at every woman
he met, hoping it would be Esther. The crowd was
getting thick; he had to push his way unceremoniously
past people; porters with luggage trucks jostled him;
he began to lose his temper&ndash;&ndash;he was just answering with
great heat a man who had cynically asked &ldquo;who he was
shoving,&rdquo; when some one touched his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky....&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Micky&rsquo;s heart beat up in his throat; he
turned quickly and found himself looking down into the
brown eyes of Marie Deland.</p>
<p>If she had hoped for anything better, it must have
been a shock to her to see the bitter disappointment in
Micky&rsquo;s face. He stammered out that he had not expected
to see her, that he was in a deuce of a hurry;
he hoped she would forgive him, but&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky, by all that&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; said another voice,
and there was Marie&rsquo;s father, the good-natured old man
who had pretended to agree with his wife when she raved
against Micky for the cavalier way in which he had
treated his daughter, but who in his heart had indulged
in a quiet chuckle, thinking that Micky had been rather
clever to escape from the toils at the eleventh hour.</p>
<p>He shook hands with Micky heartily enough; he, at
any rate, had no grudge against him. He asked Micky
a hundred questions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going over, my boy? Come with us. I&rsquo;ve
got a reserved carriage on the Paris express. Delighted
to see you. Marie and I are just off for a little holiday
by ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He touched his daughter&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Ask him to join
us, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky did his best to answer civilly; he was in the
deuce of a hurry, he said again; he had got to meet
a friend but had missed her in the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came off in the deuce of a hurry,&rdquo; he said. He
was chafing bitterly at this enforced delay; each moment
was so precious.</p>
<p>Marie touched her father&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are only keeping Mr. Mellowes, Daddy....&rdquo;
Something in her voice made Micky&rsquo;s eyes smart. It
was hard luck that for the second time he was forced
to humiliate her. He stammered out incoherently that
he hoped they would forgive him, but he was in such
a deuce of a hurry.... He went off abruptly.</p>
<p>Everybody was off the train now, and many people
were already on the boat. Micky remembered that he
had no ticket; he entered into a hot argument with an
official, who listened to him skeptically, and took as long
as possible to make out the ticket; even when Micky had
paid he still looked suspicious.</p>
<p>The gangway was still down; Micky went on board
and stood as close to it as he could, scanning the face
of each passer.</p>
<p>Esther was not amongst them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand away there&ndash;&ndash;stand away....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky was pushed aside, and a couple of brawny seamen
hauled the gangway on to the harbour. The gap
of green water was widening slowly between the pier and
the ship&rsquo;s side. Micky felt as if he were being exiled.
Supposing she was not on the boat?</p>
<p>He turned away and searched the crowded deck. The
boat was full, and most of the people were women,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
but there was nobody who looked in the very least like
Esther.</p>
<p>She would be wearing the fur coat, he was sure&ndash;&ndash;the
coat he had given her!</p>
<p>One or two people stared at him curiously. Once he
came across Marie and her father on the leeward side
of the boat. For decency&rsquo;s sake he had to stop. He
made an inane remark on the weather and said he thought
they were going to have a smooth crossing.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s brown eyes lifted to his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t met your friend?&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>Micky had a horrible conviction that she had not believed
that he had any one to meet. He coloured in
confusion as he answered&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;no. I&rsquo;m sorry to say I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved away leaving him with her father. The
old man slipped a hand through Micky&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t notice her, my boy; women are queer cattle&ndash;&ndash;and
I expect she&rsquo;s a little sore with you still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky wished it was possible to jump overboard. He
found the old man&rsquo;s friendliness more insufferable than
the look of reproach in Marie&rsquo;s eyes. As soon as he
could he got away; he went down the companion-way
and wandered round despondently.</p>
<p>If Esther were on the boat she must have seen him and
was deliberately keeping out of his way; he glanced in
at the open door of the ladies&rsquo; cabin as he passed.</p>
<p>Several pessimistic souls who had already made up
their minds to be ill, although the sea was like a mill-pond,
had arranged themselves on the couches, with
pillows under their heads; as Micky passed the cabin
some one slammed the door smartly in his face.</p>
<p>He went upon deck again and stood looking out to
sea, with the wind stinging his face.</p>
<p>It was getting dark rapidly; the lights of Dover twinkled
through the greyness. Micky stood and watched till
they could no longer be seen. He was chilled to the
bone in spite of his warm coat; he turned the collar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
up round his throat and thrust his hands deeply into
his pockets.</p>
<p>His fingers came in contact with the telegrams he
had written in the train and forgotten to send. He swore
under his breath.</p>
<p>He kept out of the Delands&rsquo; way when they reached
Calais; he was first off the boat; he stood in the darkness
trembling with excitement.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of people pouring past him&ndash;&ndash;men,
women, and children. They all seemed happy and eager&ndash;&ndash;a
couple of Frenchmen standing near him chattered incessantly;
Micky moistened his dry lips; there was a
little nerve throbbing in his temple.</p>
<p>Supposing he never saw her again! His hands clenched
deep in his pockets ... supposing he never met the
half-shy glance of her grey eyes&ndash;&ndash;supposing he never
heard her voice any more&ndash;&ndash;or her laugh....</p>
<p>The sweat broke out on his forehead. For a moment
he closed his eyes with a sick feeling of hopelessness,
and when he opened them again he saw Esther standing
there not half a dozen paces from him.</p>
<p>The glare from a huge arc lamp shone full on her
slim figure and golden hair.</p>
<p>She was looking round her in a scared, apprehensive
way as if not knowing where to go.</p>
<p>A wave of such utter relief swept through Micky&rsquo;s
very soul that for a moment it almost turned him faint.</p>
<p>She was quite alone, but as Micky watched her he
saw a French porter in a blue blouse go up to her and
start chattering away, pointing to the small suit-case she
carried and gesticulating violently. Esther shook her
head&ndash;&ndash;Micky remembered that she knew no French&ndash;&ndash;but
the man persisted, and she shook her head again
in a frightened sort of way.</p>
<p>Micky covered the distance between them in a couple
of strides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther....&rdquo; he said, in a queer, choked sort of
voice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>She turned with a stifled scream, and a most unwilling
relief swept her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Micky!&rdquo; she said breathlessly. She put out her
hand as if to grip his arm, then drew it away, moving
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come here ... oh, how dare you
follow me...?&rdquo; she said passionately.</p>
<p>Micky took her arm very gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found your note,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had to come ...
June said....&rdquo; Then suddenly his calmness broke
&ldquo;Oh, thank God I found you&ndash;&ndash;thank God!&rdquo; he said
hoarsely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Esther seemed arrested by the emotion in Micky&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<p>She stood looking up at him with wide eyes and
parted lips, then suddenly she broke out again&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean. I&rsquo;ll never forgive June
if she sent you after me. I&rsquo;m going to Paris. I&rsquo;m not
a child to be followed and looked after like this....
Let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky released her arm at once. When he spoke his
voice was quiet and rather stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t make a scene. I have followed you
for your own sake. I know I can&rsquo;t stop you from going
to Paris. I&rsquo;m not going to try. All I do ask you is
that you will let me speak to you. If what I have to
say is useless, I give you my word of honour that I
will leave you here and let you go on to Paris alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him with stormy eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it&ndash;&ndash;it isn&rsquo;t the first time you&rsquo;ve lied
to me....&rdquo; she broke off breathlessly. Micky turned
pale, but he answered evenly enough&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite justified in saying that; I&rsquo;m not going
to try and deny it. But we can&rsquo;t stand here all night&ndash;&ndash;people
are beginning to stare at us....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; but she dropped her voice a little,
and when Micky made a slight movement forward she
followed.</p>
<p>It was cold on the quay&ndash;&ndash;there was a fresh wind blowing,
and Esther shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a restaurant place here,&rdquo; Micky said. &ldquo;I
want a meal if you don&rsquo;t; I haven&rsquo;t had anything since
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>He found a table and ordered a meal, but he knew
he should not be able to eat a thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything to eat,&rdquo; Esther said. She sat
sideways in her chair away from the table; there was a
pitiable look of strain in her face; she still gripped her
suit-case tightly. When Micky asked her to be allowed
to put it down for her she turned on him almost fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me alone&ndash;&ndash;oh, leave me alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The French garcon eyed them both interestedly. Any
one far less keen of perception than he was could have
seen that there was tragedy of some kind between this
pretty, frail-looking girl and the tall man in the big coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you were hungry, but you&rsquo;re not eating anything,&rdquo;
Esther broke out irritably. &ldquo;How much longer
are you going to make me sit here? I want to catch a
train to Paris to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no trains, except slow ones,&rdquo; Micky told
her; &ldquo;the express has gone half an hour ago. I can
find you rooms in a hotel close by for the night....&rdquo;
His eyes met hers across the table, and he broke out,
&ldquo;Esther, for God&rsquo;s sake let me explain things to you.
You&rsquo;ve all your life before you; to-morrow, if you wish
it, I&rsquo;ll go away and never see you again. But I can&rsquo;t
let you go now without telling you the truth. I ought
to have told you before&ndash;&ndash;it was for your own sake I
tried to keep it back....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her grey eyes searched his face disbelievingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve anything to say against Mr. Ashton,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;I refuse to listen. I shouldn&rsquo;t believe anything
you say, for one thing. Why, you don&rsquo;t even know
his name&ndash;&ndash;unless June has told you,&rdquo; she added breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;June has told me nothing, but I know, all the same.
I knew the first night I ever met you&ndash;&ndash;when I left you
and went back to my rooms, he was there waiting for
me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She half turned, leaning across the table, and her eyes
were like fire.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He was there&ndash;&ndash;who was there?&rdquo; she asked shrilly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ashton&ndash;&ndash;Raymond Ashton,&rdquo; Micky answered.</p>
<p>There was a tragic silence, then Esther rose to her
feet; she stood looking dazedly round her in a helpless
sort of way.</p>
<p>Micky called for the bill&ndash;&ndash;without waiting for his
change he followed Esther out into the darkness. She
offered no resistance when he drew her hand through
his arm. He did not know what on earth to do with
her; if he took her to an hotel it would mean leaving
her, and she would probably go away in the night. They
went back to the station, and Micky found a waiting-room
with a roaring fire; he dragged one of the uncomfortable
wooden benches close to it and made Esther sit
down; he closed the door and came back to her.</p>
<p>There was so much he wanted to say, and for the
life of him he did not know how to begin. She sat
there so silently; she seemed to have forgotten his presence
altogether.</p>
<p>Micky looked at her, and suddenly he broke out&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther, speak to me&ndash;&ndash;say something&ndash;&ndash;for heaven&rsquo;s
sake&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved in a curiously heavy sort of way, as if
it were an effort; she raised her eyes to his agitated
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning&ndash;&ndash;was it only this morning?&ndash;&ndash;it seems
so long ago.&rdquo; She stopped for a moment, then went on
again slowly. &ldquo;When we were at that inn in the village&ndash;&ndash;those
men with the car&ndash;&ndash;I heard them talking....&rdquo;
She stopped again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Micky.</p>
<p>She frowned as if his monosyllable had interrupted
her train of thought. She went on presently&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were talking about Paris&ndash;&ndash;and Raymond.&rdquo; And
now she raised her eyes. &ldquo;If you say that it was true
what I heard them say, I will kill you,&rdquo; she said with
sudden passion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie&ndash;&ndash;just a lie to hurt me, to
hurt me more than I&rsquo;ve been hurt already.&rdquo; She stopped,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
panting. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie&ndash;&ndash;say it&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; she drove the words
at him.</p>
<p>Micky sat down beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they said that Ashton had been married in Paris
to Mrs. Clare it was the truth,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He marvelled at the steadiness of his voice. He felt
sick with shame at the part he was having to play. He
went on incoherently&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it before you ever went to Enmore&ndash;&ndash;it was
in the London papers. I was afraid you would see it.
I persuaded June to get you down into the country. I
suppose I was a fool. I ought to have known it was
only putting things off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her and quickly away again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget him, Esther, for God&rsquo;s sake. He never cared
for you; he isn&rsquo;t worth a thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose to her feet, pushing the hair back from her
face as if she were distraught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you say such things to me?&rdquo; she said in
an odd, choked voice. &ldquo;You always hated him&ndash;&ndash;you
and June. Do you think I&rsquo;m going to believe you? Do
you think I could believe you for a moment when I have
his letters&ndash;&ndash;when he has shown me in so many ways
how he cares?... I don&rsquo;t care what you say&ndash;&ndash;I
don&rsquo;t care if the whole world were to tell me it was
true&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll never believe it till he tells me himself....&rdquo;
Her breath came gaspingly; she looked at Micky&rsquo;s white
face with passionate hatred in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know it isn&rsquo;t all a made-up story?&rdquo; she
asked him hoarsely.</p>
<p>She hardly knew what she was saying; she leaned
her arms on the mantelshelf and hid her face in them.</p>
<p>Micky let her alone; he got up and began pacing up
and down the room.</p>
<p>He deserved everything she had said; it was all his
fault that she had got this to bear. With the best intentions
in the world he had proved himself a blundering
fool.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>Esther raised her head; she had not shed a tear, but
her face was white and desolate.</p>
<p>She walked past him to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going on to Paris to-night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Nothing
you can say will stop me&ndash;&ndash;nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then I will come with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer; she fumbled helplessly with the
door handle. Micky came forward to open it for her,
and their hands touched. A little flame of red rushed
to his face; he put his shoulders to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go like this,&rdquo; he said stammering. &ldquo;How
can I let you go like this? Whatever I&rsquo;ve done, I haven&rsquo;t
deserved that you should think as badly of me as you
do. It was because I cared for you so much&ndash;&ndash;I tried
to save you pain ... perhaps it isn&rsquo;t any excuse,
but it&rsquo;s the truth.... I&rsquo;d give my very soul if I
could undo what&rsquo;s gone, if I could save you from this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was not looking at him, but the cold contempt
in her face stung him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may despise me,&rdquo; he broke out again jaggedly.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the truth I&rsquo;ve told you.... Ashton never
cared for you; that night at my rooms....&rdquo; He
stopped, he did not want to tell her, but somehow there
was a compelling force within him that drove the words
to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me he&rsquo;d had to break with you&ndash;&ndash;that he was
going away from London because of you. He said he
must marry a woman with money&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s the truth, if I
never speak again. He never cared for you, Esther&ndash;&ndash;he
was never fit to kiss the ground you walk on. He
wanted to be rid of you&ndash;&ndash;he&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky stopped; Esther had given a little strangled
cry, half-sob, half-moan, like some animal in mortal pain;
for the moment she saw the world red; hardly knowing
what she did, she lifted her hand and struck Micky
across his white face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you liar&ndash;&ndash;you liar,&rdquo; she said. The words were
a hoarse whisper, her voice was almost gone.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></div>
<p>She fell away from him, shaking in every limb; she
dropped into a chair hiding her face.</p>
<p>Micky stood like a man turned to stone. She had not
hurt him physically, though there was a red flush where
she had struck him, but he felt as if the blow had fallen
on his aching heart and his love for her.</p>
<p>It seemed a long time before either of them moved or
spoke, then Esther dragged herself to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please let me pass,&rdquo; she said in a whisper, and Micky
stood aside without a word.</p>
<p>He followed her out and inquired for a train; there
was a slow one at ten-fifty they told him. He put Esther
into a carriage and got a rug for her and a cushion. He
knew she had had nothing to eat, and he ordered a basket
to be made up at the refreshment-room. When he came
back she was sitting in a corner with her eyes closed. She
had taken off her hat, and her golden hair was tumbled
about her face. She took no notice when he put the
rug over her; she did not even open her eyes when the
train started.</p>
<p>Micky sat down in the opposite corner. He felt more
tired than he had ever done in all his life, and yet he
knew that he could not sleep; his brain seemed as if it
would never rest again. He sat with face averted from
the girl in the corner, looking out into the darkness.</p>
<p>It seemed strange to realise that he had made this
same journey dozens of times before. He felt that it
was all strange and distasteful to him. The chattering
voices of the French porters and the whistle of the engines
sounded new and quaint as if he had never heard
them before. It seemed an eternity before the train
started slowly away.</p>
<p>He leaned back and closed his eyes; his head was splitting,
and he was cold and hungry.</p>
<p>He must have dozed for a few minutes, for he was
roused by a little choking sound of sobbing. He opened
his eyes&ndash;&ndash;he was awake at once&ndash;&ndash;he looked across at
Esther. She was lying huddled up, with her face turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
against the dirty cushions of the carriage, sobbing her
heart out.</p>
<p>Micky looked at her in miserable indecision. Then
he got up impulsively, and sat down opposite to where
Esther was huddled.</p>
<p>He stretched out his hand and took hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t; I can&rsquo;t bear it,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.
He raised her hand to his lips. She had taken off her
gloves and her fingers felt like ice. He chafed them
gently between his own. She still wore the cheap little
ring which Ashton had given her months ago.</p>
<p>She let her hand lie passively in his. Perhaps she
was too miserable to remember that it was Micky, and
only realised that there was something kind and comforting
in his touch. Presently her sobs quieted. She
wiped the tears from her face and brushed back her
disordered hair.</p>
<p>Micky got up and took down the supper basket he
had managed to get at the station. There was a small
thermos of hot coffee. He poured some out and made
her drink it. If he had expected her to refuse he was
agreeably disappointed. She obeyed apathetically; she
even ate some sandwiches.</p>
<p>Micky was ravenous himself, but he would not touch
a thing till she had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be much more comfortable if you put your
feet up on the seat and tried to sleep,&rdquo; he said presently.
&ldquo;You can have my coat as well as the rug. Your
hands are like ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took off his coat as he spoke and laid it over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ve got a long journey yet,&rdquo; he said
ruefully. &ldquo;If you could get some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her head away and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>She looked very young and appealing in the depressing
light of the carriage.</p>
<p>Micky sat looking at her in silence. She cared so
little for him that she had even forgotten her anger
against him; nothing he could do or say really mattered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
to her, she was not sufficiently interested in him to even
trouble to hate him for long.</p>
<p>He wondered what June was thinking, and Miss Dearling!
He wished from the depths of his soul that he
had remembered to send those wires. There was his
car, too&ndash;&ndash;he had left that in the yard at Charing Cross&ndash;&ndash;what
the dickens would become of it?&ndash;&ndash;not that it mattered
much, he was too miserable to be seriously concerned
about anything.</p>
<p>Some minutes passed, but Esther did not move. Micky
spoke her name once softly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther....&rdquo; But she did not answer; he leaned
over and touched her hand, but she did not stir; in spite
of what she had said she was asleep.</p>
<p>Micky gave a sigh of relief. He drew his coat and
the rug more closely around her; he was very cold himself,
but that did not trouble him; he finished the contents
of the supper basket before he went back to his
own corner.</p>
<p>The train rumbled on through the night; it dragged
into many little stations and stopped jerkily, but Esther
did not wake.</p>
<p>Once when she moved and the rug slipped, Micky
rose and quietly replaced it. He was very tired himself,
but his brain would not allow him to sleep; he felt as if he
were living through years during these long hours.</p>
<p>He sat looking at Esther with wistful eyes. Why
was it that people never fell in love with the right people?
he asked himself vaguely. He could have made her so
happy.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes for a moment, then dragged them
open again. He must not go to sleep, whatever happened.
He sat up stiffly.</p>
<p>Presently he lifted a corner of the blind. The sky
looked a little lighter, as if dawn were not far away.
He looked at his watch. Nearly two!</p>
<p>A sudden impulse came to him to wake Esther and
make her listen now to what he had to say. The time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
was getting short, and there was so much to tell her and
explain.</p>
<p>He rose and bent over her, but she did not move, and
he went back again to his corner.</p>
<p>He let the window down a little way, hoping the cold
night air would help to keep him awake. The minutes
seemed to drag, though in reality only a quarter of an
hour had passed when Esther woke with a little smothered
cry.</p>
<p>Micky was on his feet in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ve
been asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rubbed her eyes childishly with her knuckles; she
stared at him for a moment unrecognisingly, then, as
memory returned, she shrank back into her corner.</p>
<p>Micky picked up the rug and coat that had slithered
to the floor; he waited a few moments till he saw that
she was quite awake before he spoke, then he said
gently&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you feel better. We shall soon be in now.
Are you warm enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be into Paris very soon,&rdquo; he said again;
&ldquo;and there is a great deal I want to say to you first.
Will you listen to me if I try to explain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She met his eyes unflinchingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one man who can possibly explain anything
to me,&rdquo; she said then, &ldquo;and he is not you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky lost his temper; he was cold and tired and
hungry, and at that moment she seemed the most unreasonable
of mortals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not allow you to see Ashton, if you mean Ashton,&rdquo;
he said roughly. &ldquo;The man isn&rsquo;t fit for you to
think about. He&rsquo;s married, you know that ... Esther,
for your own sake&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had turned her face away and was looking out
into the darkness; she seemed not to be listening.</p>
<p>Micky went on urgently.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I blame myself. I always meant to tell you before
things had gone as far as this. I shall never forgive
myself for not having done so. I&rsquo;ve behaved like a cad,
but my only excuse is that I loved you; I wanted to
spare you unnecessary pain&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He was no longer
stammering and self-conscious, his voice was firm and
steady. &ldquo;I suppose I was a fool to imagine that I could
ever make you care for me; I suppose it was conceit
that led me to think I could ever cut out this ... this
phantom lover of yours&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He laughed mirthlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther, let me take you back home; it&rsquo;s no use seeing
Ashton&ndash;&ndash;it only means humiliation and pain for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her lips moved, but no words came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take you home to June,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;She
will tell you that what I say is only the truth. She
knows him&ndash;&ndash;she....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She always hated him; it isn&rsquo;t likely she would wish
me to marry him.&rdquo; She bit her lip. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s no use
saying any more,&rdquo; she broke out wildly after a moment.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see him&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t bear it if I don&rsquo;t see
him&ndash;&ndash;just once! I&rsquo;ve got to hear the truth&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you the truth,&rdquo; he repeated doggedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
no interest to me to try and prevent you from seeing
him. I know I&rsquo;ve done for whatever chance I had with
you. Oh, for heaven&rsquo;s sake believe that it&rsquo;s only for
your sake I want to take you back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>In her heart she found it impossible to believe him;
she thought of the letters she had received from Raymond,
the money&ndash;&ndash;the presents&ndash;&ndash;why even this coat she
wore had come from him; she felt that she could laugh
at this man opposite to her. A little smile curved her
lips; a contemptuous smile it seemed to Micky.</p>
<p>For the first time the injustice of it all seemed to
strike him; for him who had done his best she had nothing
but dislike and contempt, but for the man who had
left her with a brutal letter of farewell, who had thrown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
her over because she had no money, she had endless faith
and trust, and love!</p>
<p>He broke out in his agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to spare you&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve done my best, but you
won&rsquo;t let me ... I&rsquo;ve kept back the truth, but now
you&rsquo;ll have to hear it if nothing else will keep you from
him. He&rsquo;s never given you a thought since he left London&ndash;&ndash;he
imagines that you&rsquo;ve forgotten him. It was
he you saw at the Comedy Theatre that night when June
and I were with you. He didn&rsquo;t even trouble to let you
know that he was in London&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s how he cares for
you&ndash;&ndash;this man you refuse to believe one word against
...&rdquo; His eyes flamed as they met hers.</p>
<p>She was staring at him now; her face was white and
incredulous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&ndash;&ndash;if you think I&rsquo;m going to believe that&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
she began, in a high, unnatural voice. She stopped; she
seemed to realise all at once that he was speaking the
truth. She leaned towards him. Her breath came in
broken gasps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those letters!&rdquo; she said shrilly. &ldquo;Whose letters?
They were from him&ndash;&ndash;they were from him&ndash;&ndash;weren&rsquo;t
they from him?&rdquo; she asked hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Micky doggedly.</p>
<p>Better to hurt her now, he told himself, than to let
her go on to worse pain and humiliation.</p>
<p>There was a tragic silence; then she asked again, in
a whisper&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who&ndash;&ndash;who wrote them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wave of crimson flooded Micky&rsquo;s white face. He
dropped his head in his hands as if he could not bear
to meet her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; he said brokenly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
</div>
<p>A long moment of silence followed Micky&rsquo;s broken
confession. He dared not look at Esther, though
she was staring at him, staring hard, with a curious
sort of wonderment in her grey eyes. Then all at once
she began to laugh, a laugh which held no real mirth,
only incredulity.</p>
<p>Micky raised his head sharply.</p>
<p>For a second they stared at one another; then Micky
said hoarsely&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe me&rdquo;; and then again, more slowly:
&ldquo;You mean that you&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t believe&ndash;&ndash;me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He half rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther, I implore you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved back from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was clever of you&ndash;&ndash;to think of such an excuse,&rdquo;
she said unevenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth; I swear it if I never speak again. I
know now that I must have been out of my mind to attempt
such a thing, but it has only seemed impossible
since you showed me how little you thought of me. I
wrote those letters&ndash;&ndash;every one of them. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the excitement of the moment neither of them had
noticed that the train had reached its destination and
was slowly stopping.</p>
<p>A voluble porter had already wrenched open the door
and was imploring monsieur to accept his services; it
was impossible to say any more to Esther.</p>
<p>Micky followed her out on to the platform; he felt
that the last shred of his patience and tenderness had
been killed.</p>
<p>She did not believe him&ndash;&ndash;whatever he said she would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
never believe him; it was useless to waste his breath;
he might as well give up and let her go her own way;
perhaps a sharp lesson would teach her better and more
quickly than all his love had been able to do.</p>
<p>He was dispirited and hungry, and hunger alone makes
a man angry. He looked at the girl for whose sake he
had raced all these miles of wild-goose chase, and a
boorish longing to hurt her, to let her suffer rose in
his heart.</p>
<p>Let her go to Ashton and see for herself the sort of
man he was.</p>
<p>He spoke with savage impulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t bother you with my unwelcome company any
longer. You will be able to get breakfast in the restaurant,
and you will find that most people here understand
English.... Good-bye&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther gave a little gasp&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to leave me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hardness of his eyes did not soften.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not trying to tell me that you wish me to
stay, surely?&rdquo; he submitted drily.</p>
<p>She raised her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not; after all, it&rsquo;s your own fault you came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer, perhaps he could not trust himself;
he raised his hat and turned away unseeingly, and
Esther clutched her suit-case tightly and walked away
with her head in the air, trying to look as if she knew
every inch of the Gare St. Lazare and had been there
thousands of times before.</p>
<p>But her heart was beating up in her throat, and she
would have given a great deal, had it been compatible
with dignity, to rush after him and beg him to stay.</p>
<p>She wandered out of the station, not knowing where
to go, Raymond seemed to have faded into the background;
she only thought of him subconsciously; it was
the figure of Micky Mellowes that worried her&ndash;&ndash;she
could not forget him.</p>
<p>Supposing he had really written those letters? &ldquo;But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she told herself in an agony. &ldquo;I know he
didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took one of the letters from her suit-case and
stared at the handwriting&ndash;&ndash;Raymond&rsquo;s writing. The
whole thing was too preposterous.</p>
<p>She did not know what she meant to do, or where
she meant to go; it no longer seemed that she had come
here for any specific purpose.</p>
<p>The early morning greyness and chilliness had faded;
the sun had risen and cleared away the mists.</p>
<p>She found herself in some gardens where an elderly
man was feeding sparrows; she sat down on a bench
and watched him.</p>
<p>It seemed years ago that she went down to Enmore
with June&ndash;&ndash;since she sat in the little inn with Micky and
heard those two men talking.</p>
<p>The hot blood beat into her cheeks as she remembered
something that for the moment she had forgotten&ndash;&ndash;that
Raymond Ashton was married!</p>
<p>The man gave the sparrows his last crumbs and went
away. The little brown birds came hopping to Esther&rsquo;s
feet, looking up at her with bright, eager eyes, as if
expecting her to supply a further meal.</p>
<p>The sun faded and went in, and a few drops of rain
came pattering down. She rose and began to walk on
slowly. The light suit-case seemed to have grown heavy
since yesterday.</p>
<p>At the back of her mind was the frightened knowledge
that she was alone in Paris; that she had nobody
to turn to now that Micky had deserted her; but as
yet it was only in the background. Raymond was somewhere,
perhaps quite close; but she no longer felt that
she wanted to go to him.</p>
<p>Further on she found another bench sheltered under
some trees and sat down again; she opened the suit-case
and took out a bundle of Micky&rsquo;s letters ...
Micky&rsquo;s! No, Raymond&rsquo;s.... Oh, whose letters
were they?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>She opened the one that had been written from the
hotel in Paris. Its fond words seemed to take on a new
meaning....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day, if all that I wish for comes true, I will
tell you the many things you would not let me say
when we were last together....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The one sentence caught her eye. She wondered that
she had never before thought how unlike Raymond this
was. Why was it she had not realised before that Raymond
could never have written this?</p>
<p>Somewhere in the distance a church clock chimed;
Esther found herself mechanically counting the bells&ndash;&ndash;nine,
ten, eleven! All those hours since Micky had left
her at the station.</p>
<p>She was cold and hungry, but it did not seem to matter;
she felt there was a great, unanswered question in
her mind which she must settle.</p>
<p>She rose and walked on again; she turned out of the
gardens and found herself in a street of shops. People
looked at her curiously.</p>
<p>Hardly knowing that she did so, she stopped and
looked in at a jeweller&rsquo;s window; there were trays of
precious stones. She felt her own ring beneath the
glove&ndash;&ndash;she had worn it so long now, she wondered how
she would feel when she had to take it off. Of course,
she could not go on wearing it if Raymond was really
married.</p>
<p>Micky had once gone into a pond on a bitter night to
save a kitten from drowning; she wondered what made
her remember that.</p>
<p>The man who could save a drowning kitten would
never hurt a woman so that she could hardly think or
feel; June had claimed for Micky that he was the best
man in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t believe in him&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t believe anything
he says,&rdquo; Esther told herself feverishly; she moved on
again away from the trays of flashing diamonds.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>Two girls passing her were chattering in French&ndash;&ndash;Esther
looked after them vaguely.</p>
<p>This was really Paris&ndash;&ndash;this rather noisy, confusing
place; the Paris she had longed to see.</p>
<p>A man passing stared at her, half stopped, went on
again, then turned, paused irresolutely, and finally came
back.</p>
<p>He walked quickly till he drew abreast with her, and
there was a curious eagerness in his face as he stooped
a little to look down at hers; then he gave an exclamation
of sheer amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lallie! Good heavens! What in the world are you
doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Raymond Ashton.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
</div>
<p>And so the dream had come true after all, and she
and Raymond were together in Paris.</p>
<p>As she looked up into his handsome face it
seemed to Esther that all the past hours of grief were
as if they had never really existed; he was smiling down
at her in the same old way; the very tone of his voice
awoke forgotten memories in her heart; she felt as if
a gnawing pain which had allowed her no rest had suddenly
been lulled to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it must be you,&rdquo; Raymond was saying nervously.
&ldquo;And yet I could not be sure. Somehow I
never thought of you and Paris as being in any way
compatible, and yet&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He broke off; it had been on
the tip of his tongue to say that she had never looked
sweeter or more desirable.</p>
<p>His overwhelming conceit suddenly woke the wish
in his heart to know if she still cared, or if she had
forgotten him, and a little flush crossed his face and his
eyes grew tender as they met the tragedy of hers; he
looked hastily round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t talk here. Will you come to a caf&eacute;? There
is so much I should like to say to you. When did you
come over? What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were walking slowly along, the man&rsquo;s head bent
ardently towards her.</p>
<p>He had once told Micky that this girl was the only
woman he had ever loved, and perhaps it was right&ndash;&ndash;as
he accounted love.</p>
<p>He took her to a caf&eacute;&ndash;&ndash;one where there would be
nobody likely to recognise him; he ordered coffee and
biscuits.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we can talk undisturbed,&rdquo; he said; he moved his
chair closer to Esther&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;he laid his hand on hers.</p>
<p>She did not move or try to evade his touch; she just
looked down at his hand for a moment and then up at
the handsome face which had for so long meant all the
world to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought we should meet again here of all
places,&rdquo; he said in his soft voice. &ldquo;How long ago does
it seem to you since we said good-bye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not answer, but the thought floated through
her mind that they never had said good-bye, that he had
just walked out of her life and stayed away until this
moment, when fate had thrown them together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you knew how often I have thought about you,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get my letter, Lallie? The one I wrote on
New Year&rsquo;s Eve&ndash;&ndash;and the money? I sent you some
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A swift flush dyed her cheeks; she raised her eyes.</p>
<p>That had been his letter then, after all&ndash;&ndash;Micky had
lied to her; she caught her breath on a little gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said faintly. &ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;yes, I got it&ndash;&ndash;thank
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often thought since that I might have written
you a kinder letter,&rdquo; he said after a moment. &ldquo;But
everything had gone wrong then&ndash;&ndash;the mater cut up
rough&ndash;&ndash;and I was up to my eyes in debt. It was the
best thing for both of us to put an end to it, don&rsquo;t you
think it was? You used to say that you wouldn&rsquo;t mind
being poor, but in the end you&rsquo;d have hated it as much
as I should.&rdquo; He paused as if expecting her to speak,
but she was plucking at the blue-and-white fringe of
the tablecloth with nervous fingers.</p>
<p>What did he mean&ndash;&ndash;that he might have written her a
kinder letter&ndash;&ndash;when she always remembered it as one
of the dearest she had ever received?</p>
<p>He went on again&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It hurt me more than you&rsquo;ll ever know.&rdquo; There was
a sort of self-satisfaction in his voice. &ldquo;It took me a
long time to forget you, Lallie, and then, just as I was
beginning, I saw you at the theatre&ndash;&ndash;in the stalls ...
with Mellowes.&rdquo; His brows met above his handsome
eyes. &ldquo;Mellowes wasn&rsquo;t long picking you up,&rdquo; he added
jealously.</p>
<p>Her lip quivered, but she did not raise her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw me, too, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;I know
you did, because Mellowes came round afterwards and
cursed me to all eternity.&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;I should have
made a point of seeing you the next day if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for his confounded interference,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;He
told me to get out of London and leave you alone.&rdquo; He
bent towards her a little. &ldquo;What is Mellowes to you?&rdquo;
he asked her deliberately.</p>
<p>She raised her eyes now, and somehow it seemed as
if, in the last few moments, the man she had known and
loved had changed into a stranger&ndash;&ndash;some one whom she
had never seen before, whom she hoped never to see
again.</p>
<p>She forced her lips to smile; she felt at that moment
she would die rather than let him see how she was suffering,
or guess how she had suffered in the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been kind to me,&rdquo; she said voicelessly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raymond made a little, inarticulate sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got me to thank for ever getting to know you,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I gave him your address and asked him to
take you out a bit if he fancied it.... I asked him
to be kind to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hands in her lap twitched convulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d had one tenth of his beastly money,&rdquo; Raymond
said then savagely, &ldquo;we shouldn&rsquo;t be sitting here
now as if we were strangers&ndash;&ndash;as if ... Lallie&ndash;&ndash;do
you remember the good time we used to have&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember everything.&rdquo; He bent closer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I never cared for any woman in all my life but you.
It&rsquo;s cursed hard luck.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m
married?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; The words came stiffly.</p>
<p>His eyes searched her white face jealously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to care. I&rsquo;ve often wondered if you
knew&ndash;&ndash;and if you minded!&rdquo; He sat staring before him,
and there was a little smile in his eyes. &ldquo;We do things
in style now, I can tell you,&rdquo; he said with sudden change
of voice. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s as rich as you please, and she likes to
spend her money.&rdquo; Another silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll be happy,&rdquo; Esther said faintly.</p>
<p>Afterwards she wondered what made her say it, seeing
that she did not care in the very least if he were
happy or not; why should she care? This man was a
stranger to her.</p>
<p>He laughed ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose we shall,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a bad
sort, and she lets me alone....&rdquo; He roused himself
suddenly and bent closer to her. &ldquo;Lallie&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ll let me
see you again. There&rsquo;s no reason why we can&rsquo;t be&ndash;&ndash;friends&ndash;&ndash;just
because I&rsquo;m married&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He tried to
take her hand, but now she repulsed him, though very
gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to be a little prude?&rdquo; he said in a
whisper. &ldquo;I can give you the time of your life if you&rsquo;ll
let me. I&rsquo;ve plenty of money now&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife&rsquo;s money,&rdquo; said Esther with stiff lips.</p>
<p>He looked annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like to put it that way&ndash;&ndash;but she doesn&rsquo;t mind&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s
too fond of me to mind how much I spend ...
Lallie&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She hated to hear that name, because once
she had loved it.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes for a moment with a little sick
shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you faint?&rdquo; he asked anxiously. &ldquo;I suppose it
is warm in here. Take your coat off! Jove! that&rsquo;s a
fine coat&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He ran an appreciative hand down the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
soft fur sleeve; a sudden suspicion crept into his eyes.
&ldquo;Who gave you that?&rdquo; he asked sharply. &ldquo;Not Mellowes&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;at least....&rdquo; She could not go on. Micky
had given it to her, she knew, but she would have bitten
her tongue through rather than have told this man.</p>
<p>It had been Micky all the time&ndash;&ndash;Micky....</p>
<p>She thrust the thought of him from her; she did not
want to think of him now. There would be plenty of
time later on; plenty of time when she had shaken
off the last rag of the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cost a pretty penny, whoever bought it,&rdquo; he said
sulkily. &ldquo;What else has he given you? If you can take
presents from him you can&rsquo;t refuse to let me see you
sometimes, and after all&ndash;&ndash;you did love me once....
Esther, do you remember the way you cried that last
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said mechanically, &ldquo;I remember; I remember
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You loved me well enough then,&rdquo; he reminded her
moodily. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t behave like an iceberg then, Lallie,
and I&rsquo;m not really changed; I&rsquo;m the same man I was&ndash;&ndash;I
care for you just as much&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re married!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She felt as if she had so much time mapped out before
her during which she must put up with this man&rsquo;s
society; as if each moment were another inch torn in
the rags of disillusionment which had got to be destroyed
thoroughly before she could ever hope to gather up the
broken threads of her life again.</p>
<p>He laughed at her reminder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the only married man who sometimes forgets
that he is no longer a bachelor,&rdquo; he said detestably.</p>
<p>He laid an arm familiarly along the back of her chair.
He touched her chin with his fingers.</p>
<p>She moved back, the hot blood rushing riotously over
her face. She was white no longer; she looked like a
marble Galatea suddenly brought to life.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></div>
<p>Raymond Ashton laughed, well pleased. He was confident
that he had not lost his power over her. For the
moment his appalling vanity blinded him to the fact that
it was not love in her eyes, but scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking, Lallie?&rdquo; he asked her.</p>
<p>She sat very straight and stiff in her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thinking,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how impossible it seems
that I can ever have thought that I cared for you.&rdquo; Her
voice was low but very clear, and he heard each word
distinctly. &ldquo;I am thinking that you are the most contemptible
thing I have ever met in my life&ndash;&ndash;I am thinking
how sorry I am for the woman who is your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pushed back her chair and rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to hear any more of my thoughts?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>Ashton had risen too; there was a look of bewildered
amazement in his face; he tried to laugh. Even now he
thought she was joking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lallie&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he said hoarsely. He half held his hand to
her. &ldquo;Lallie&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he said again&ndash;&ndash;but the cold contempt
of her face struck the appeal from her lips.</p>
<p>He drew himself up with a poor attempt at dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So virtue is to be the order of the day, is it?&rdquo; he
said sneeringly. &ldquo;Very well&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; His eyes flamed as
they rested on her face. &ldquo;It makes one wonder why
you are here&ndash;&ndash;in Paris&ndash;&ndash;alone!&rdquo; he said insultingly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;If
you are alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little point of silence. For a moment
Esther scanned his handsome face as if she were trying
to remember what it was she had ever loved in him&ndash;&ndash;his
eyes!&ndash;&ndash;but they were so cruel and insolent&ndash;&ndash;his lips
... she shuddered, realising that in all her life she
could never undo the memory of his kisses&ndash;&ndash;then she
pulled herself together with a great effort and turned
away.</p>
<p>He followed. His amazement had gone now&ndash;&ndash;he was
merely furiously angry&ndash;&ndash;his face was crimson&ndash;&ndash;he caught
her arm in a grip that hurt.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;My God, you&rsquo;re not going like this,&rdquo; he said furiously.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a few weeks ago that you were crying round
my neck and begging me not to throw you over. Oh,
that hurts, does it?&rdquo; he said as she winced. &ldquo;I dare say
you&rsquo;d like all that wiped out and forgotten. But I&rsquo;ve
got a few letters to remember you by&ndash;&ndash;a few letters that
would hardly make pleasant reading for the next man
who is fool enough to waste his time on you&ndash;&ndash;and I
promise you I&rsquo;ll send them along if it&rsquo;s Mellowes or any
other man&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised triumphant eyes to his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t read them,&rdquo; she said passionately. &ldquo;Send
them if you like; but he wouldn&rsquo;t read them&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She
was not conscious of the admission in her words&ndash;&ndash;she
only knew that the knowledge that Micky was there
somewhere in the background gave her the strength to
defy Ashton.</p>
<p>She saw the sudden fury that filled his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&ndash;&ndash;then you admit that it&rsquo;s Mellowes,&rdquo; he stammered.
&ldquo;That it&rsquo;s he who has taken my place&ndash;&ndash;who
has cut me out&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; His voice changed to a sort of
threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have know what he meant to do. I might
have guessed. Wait till I see him&ndash;&ndash;wait till I get back
to London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther smiled&ndash;&ndash;a little smile of security and confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no need to wait,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;Mr.
Mellowes is here in Paris with me, if you wish to see
him.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
</div>
<p>Ashton echoed Esther&rsquo;s words hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! With you! in Paris!... Micky&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wave of bitterest jealousy surged through him.
He fell back a step, struck dumb by the force of his
emotions, and Esther fled away from him down the street.</p>
<p>She seemed to have awakened all at once to her true
position. She was alone, with only a few shillings in her
pocket and in a strange city.</p>
<p>She was tired to death. She felt as if her limbs would
give way beneath her. The driver of a fiacre looked at
her and drew his horse to the kerb.</p>
<p>Esther nodded; she threw her suit-case on to the seat
and clambered in after it.</p>
<p>But where to go? The old blinding fear of her loneliness
rushed back. Where could she go?</p>
<p>Then she suddenly remembered the hotel from which
Micky had written to her. She would go there. It would
be somewhere at least to sleep and rest.</p>
<p>It was only a little drive to the hotel; she wished it
had been longer.</p>
<p>A commissionaire came forward, and said something
in French. She looked up at him, but his face seemed
all indistinct and unreal. She tried to answer, but her
own voice sounded as if it were miles away.</p>
<p>They were in the small, rather dreary lounge. Esther
passed a hand across her eyes. She must conquer this
absurd weakness. She forced herself to remember that
she was alone, but she felt as if she had no will-power
left.</p>
<p>A door in front of her opened suddenly, and a man
came into the lounge.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></div>
<p>When he saw Esther he stopped. The hot colour
rushed to his face. He seemed to be waiting for some
sign from her. For a moment their eyes met; then,
hardly knowing what she did, Esther held out her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please,&rdquo; she said faintly, &ldquo;oh, please tell me&ndash;&ndash;what
I am to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for the next few minutes she was past remembering
anything, though she never really lost consciousness.
She only knew that everything was all right now
Micky was here&ndash;&ndash;and the sheer relief the knowledge
brought with it for the time threw her into a sort of
apathy.</p>
<p>Some one took off her hat and the big fur coat that
had grown so heavy; some one had bathed her face and
unlaced her shoes, and now Micky stood there looking
down at her with eyes that hurt, though they smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told them to bring lunch in here,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll like it better than the public room&ndash;&ndash;and I haven&rsquo;t
had mine yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther looked up at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can we&ndash;&ndash;can we go back to London to-day?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can go any time you like,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He felt he had aged years during that morning. No
sooner had Esther got out of his sight at the station than
he was beside himself with remorse for having allowed
her to go; he had spent the whole morning wandering
about looking for her. He had been to this hotel a
dozen times; he had only just come in again when she
followed.</p>
<p>The relief of having her safely in his charge once more
was almost more than he could bear. He walked over
to the door, then stopped and looked back at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t ... you won&rsquo;t run away from me
again, will you?&rdquo; he asked. For the first time there was
real emotion in his voice.</p>
<p>Esther had been sitting looking into the fire; she raised
her head now.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; she said tremulously. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t go.
I want to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flushed crimson, he tried to make some excuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another time.... You&rsquo;re tired. I&rsquo;ll come back
presently. You ought to get some rest if we&rsquo;re to go
back to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It must be now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shut the door, but he kept as far away from her
as possible, standing over by the window that looked
into the dreary winter garden.</p>
<p>There was something implacable about his tall figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, won&rsquo;t you come here?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>He obeyed at once. He rested an elbow on the mantelshelf
and kept his eyes fixed on the fire.</p>
<p>There as a little silence, then Esther said, almost in
a whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to beg your pardon. I hope you will&ndash;&ndash;will
try and forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky did not move.</p>
<p>She struggled on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen ... Mr. Ashton.&rdquo; Somehow she could
not bring herself to speak of him by his Christian name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I know&ndash;&ndash;I know&ndash;&ndash;that I&rsquo;ve been&ndash;&ndash;been a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice broke. She gripped the arms of the chair
hard to keep herself from breaking down.</p>
<p>Micky forced himself to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve seen him&ndash;&ndash;as you wished it,&rdquo; he said
jerkily. &ldquo;But as hoping I will forgive you, there&rsquo;s nothing
to forgive&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s all the other way on. I behaved like&ndash;&ndash;like
a cad&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s for you to forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we&rsquo;ve both said the right thing I&rsquo;ll go and
see about that train,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But again she stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to go&ndash;&ndash;I want to talk to you. I
want ... oh, I don&rsquo;t know what I do want!&rdquo; she
finished, with a sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re tired out,&rdquo; Micky said calmly, though he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
looked anything but calm, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to bully you
and insist that you rest. I&rsquo;ll come back presently....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went away quickly, as if he were afraid of being
kept against his will but outside the door he stood still
for a moment with his hand over his eyes before he
pulled himself together and went on.</p>
<p>Esther listened to his departing steps with a sinking at
her heart.</p>
<p>What had she hoped for? She hardly knew, but she
felt as if she had made an overture of friendship that
had been kindly but decidedly refused.</p>
<p>Her cheeks burned. It was not what she had expected.</p>
<p>It seemed an eternity till Micky came back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a train in half an hour,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;We
can get back to town very comfortably. I&rsquo;ve wired to
June to meet us. She probably came up from Enmore
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June! Esther had almost forgotten June.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be getting ready if we are to catch
that train,&rdquo; Micky said. &ldquo;Would you rather stay till
to-morrow? I&rsquo;m afraid the journey will tire you dreadfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose hurriedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&ndash;&ndash;oh no, I&rsquo;d much rather go!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Micky had reserved a carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I will go in a smoker,&rdquo; he said. He put some
magazines and a box of chocolates on the seat; he avoided
looking at her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a corridor train so I&rsquo;ll come and
see that you are all right occasionally&ndash;&ndash;if I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer; she felt a little chill of disappointment.
He had not asked a single question about
Raymond, and now he was suggesting that they travel
the long journey separately.</p>
<p>He hesitated.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be all right?&rdquo; he asked awkwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went away, and presently the train started. Esther
looked out of the window and watched the city as it
was rapidly left behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never want to see it again,&rdquo; was the thought in
her heart. &ldquo;I wish I never had seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt like a naughty child who has run away from
home and is being ignominiously brought back.</p>
<p>Last night seemed like some fevered dream; Raymond
Ashton some man of whom she had read in a book or
seen in a play.</p>
<p>A phantom lover!&ndash;&ndash;he had not even been that, and
once she had wished to die because she had got to be
separated from him.</p>
<p>Her eyes fell on her hand&ndash;&ndash;she still wore his ring.</p>
<p>With sudden passion she dragged it from her finger;
she let the window down with a run and flung the ring
far out into the grey evening. It was the end of a dream;
the final uprooting of an illusion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
</div>
<p>Esther slept through the long journey fitfully&ndash;&ndash;she
was mentally and physically exhausted. She
was only thoroughly aroused by people out in the
corridor moving about collecting bags and baggage.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes with a confused feeling&ndash;&ndash;the train
was slackening speed, and Micky stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are nearly in,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The train was almost at a standstill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calais! Calais!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther rose to her feet&ndash;&ndash;her limbs were trembling, and
her head ached dully.</p>
<p>Micky took her suit-case from the rack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better fasten your coat,&rdquo; he said casually. &ldquo;It
will be cold on the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him half fearfully. Was this the same
man who had followed her from Enmore with such passionate
haste and eagerness? He was perfectly undisturbed
now at all events, he seemed even to avoid looking
at her.</p>
<p>When they got on board he found her a chair on the
leeside of the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a good sailor?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve never been any distance until
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better stay here; it&rsquo;s preferable to that stuffy
cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he left her alone almost the whole time, though
she knew that he walked up and down close to where
she sat. She could see the glow of his cigar through
the darkness and hear the slow sound of his steps.</p>
<p>She tried to think things over quietly as she sat there,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
but everything seemed so unreal, and most of all the fact
that Micky had once professed to love her.</p>
<p>In the train he left her to herself till they reached
London. He was sure she &ldquo;did not want to be bothered,&rdquo;
he said, and he was going to smoke.</p>
<p>Esther felt a little pang of disappointment. It seemed
a long time till the train steamed fussily into Charing
Cross; and the old weary feeling of loneliness had settled
again upon her heart by the time Micky came to the
door of the carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;June is sure to be somewhere about,&rdquo; he said laconically.
&ldquo;Will you stay here while I see if I can find her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took a hurried step forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll come with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt afraid of June&rsquo;s kindly quizzical eyes; June
who knew why she had run away to Paris, and what
had been awaiting her there.</p>
<p>She touched Micky&rsquo;s arm&ndash;&ndash;the eyes she raised to his
face were troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall I see you again?&rdquo; she asked falteringly.</p>
<p>He half smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to see me again?&rdquo; he questioned
gravely. &ldquo;You can have no use for me&ndash;&ndash;after this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther flushed painfully. Through the crowd she saw
June pushing towards them. This was the last moment
she would have with Micky, she knew, and in a flash
something seemed to tell her what this man had meant
to her during the last two terrible days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said tremblingly, &ldquo;if you only would let
me thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky laughed harshly&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate thanks,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>June was upon them; she seized Esther and kissed
her rapturously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You darling! You&rsquo;ll never know how glad I am to
see you. I&rsquo;ve been here for hours. Aren&rsquo;t you dead
tired? Micky, she looks worn out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she?&rdquo; said Micky.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></div>
<p>He was dead beat himself; he looked round vacantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wired Driver&ndash;&ndash;I thought he&rsquo;d be here....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, sir,&rdquo; said a voice at his elbow, and there was
Driver, stolid and impenetrable as ever.</p>
<p>Micky was unfeignedly glad to see the little man;
for almost the first time in his life he realised that sometimes
dullness and short-sightedness are a blessing in
disguise. Apparently to Driver there was nothing odd
in this mad rush over to Paris; his expressionless eyes
saw the untidiness of his master&rsquo; toilet without changing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought the car, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good man; get me a taxi, then. You must take the car
down to your rooms,&rdquo; Micky said to June. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t
argue; I insist&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put the two girls into the car; he did not look
at Esther, though he squeezed June&rsquo;s hand when he said
good-bye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me know if you get back all right; I shall see
you soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his hat, stood aside, and the car started forward.</p>
<p>June looked at Esther with a sort of shyness. It
seemed as if years must have passed since they were
down at Enmore.</p>
<p>The car had rolled out of the station and into the
heart of London before either of them spoke; then Esther
said, stiltedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was kind of you to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t kind at all,&rdquo; she said bluntly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my
friends, or, at least, you were, and, as for Micky&ndash;&ndash;well,
I love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sort of defiance in her voice. She had
seen the tired, strained look in Micky&rsquo;s face, and she
was nearer being angry with Esther than she had ever
been, but she turned and took her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow I never thought I should see you again,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
she said, with real emotion. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t slept a wink
since you went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re much too good to me,&rdquo; Esther said. &ldquo;Everyone
is much too good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Micky is, certainly,&rdquo; June agreed exasperatedly.
&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s a perfect fool to run about like he
does after a woman who doesn&rsquo;t care two hoots about
him.... There! now I oughtn&rsquo;t to have said that.
Esther, if you&rsquo;re crying....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther had covered her face with her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not crying,&rdquo; she said in a stifled voice. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m
so ashamed. I don&rsquo;t know what you must think of me&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s
so&ndash;&ndash;so humiliating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing of the kind,&rdquo; June declared. &ldquo;The only
mistake you&rsquo;ve made is to put your money on the wrong
man, if you&rsquo;ll excuse the expression. Raymond Ashton
was always an outsider.... There! I won&rsquo;t say
another word. You&rsquo;ve come home, and that&rsquo;s all that
matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only when they were safely up in the room with
the mauve cushions that she flung her hat down on the
sofa and drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never thought we should be here together
again,&rdquo; she said tragically. &ldquo;It seemed like the end of
everything when I found your note on the pincushion.
I don&rsquo;t know what I should have done if it hadn&rsquo;t been
for Micky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I should have done either,&rdquo; Esther
said. She met June&rsquo;s eyes and flushed crimson. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been horrid about him, I know,&rdquo; she added bravely. &ldquo;And
now I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June said &ldquo;Humph.&rdquo; She sat for a moment staring
at the floor, then she got up and searched for the inevitable
cigarettes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to go to bed,&rdquo; she said in her most matter-of-fact
tone. &ldquo;Where did you sleep last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowhere&ndash;&ndash;at least&ndash;&ndash;we were in the train all night.
I did sleep a little, but....&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></div>
<p>June took her by the shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off you go to bed, and don&rsquo;t argue. I&rsquo;ve had a fire
put in your room, and Charlie is there with a new bow
on. I&rsquo;ll come and tuck you up when you&rsquo;re ready,
and....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Esther refused to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep if I went to bed. I want to tell you
about&ndash;&ndash;about what&rsquo;s happened....&rdquo; She paused
breathlessly, but June was not going to help her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear anything,&rdquo; she said flatly. She
looked at Esther and saw the tears in the younger girl&rsquo;s
eyes. She put an arm round her, drawing her down to
the sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all about it, then,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just&ndash;&ndash;just
longing to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t much to tell, except&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Esther held
out her left hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not engaged any more,&rdquo; she
said with a faint attempt to laugh. &ldquo;He&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Ashton&ndash;&ndash;is
married....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&ndash;&ndash;Micky told me before we went to Enmore.
I hope he&rsquo;s married a vixen who&rsquo;ll lead him an awful
dance. It would serve her right to let her know the
sort of man he is&ndash;&ndash;to let her know the sort of letters he&rsquo;s
been writing to you&ndash;&ndash;to show him up properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther hid her face in the mauve cushions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but he has never written to me,&rdquo; she said chokingly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had a letter from him since he went
away, and that was on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. It&rsquo;s all been
a mistake&ndash;&ndash;a sham ... he never cared for me&ndash;&ndash;he
never really wanted me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>June threw away the cigarette and tried to raise Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about? He did write to you&ndash;&ndash;you
told me yourself that he wrote beautiful letters&ndash;&ndash;he
sent you that money&ndash;&ndash;Esther! what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther looked up; for a moment June caught a glimpse
of misty, shamed eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t from him: those letters&ndash;&ndash;the money
never came from him,&rdquo; she said in a stifled voice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What! My good child, have you gone out of your
mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>June was a hundred miles from guessing the truth.
&ldquo;If he didn&rsquo;t write them, then who in the world did?&rdquo;
she demanded crisply. &ldquo;And if he didn&rsquo;t send the money,
who in the wide world....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught her breath on a sudden illuminating
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther ... not&ndash;&ndash;not&ndash;&ndash;Micky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; It was the smallest whisper, and it was followed
by a tragic silence; then June got up and began
walking aimlessly about the room; she felt as if she had
been robbed of all breath.</p>
<p>Twice she turned and looked at Esther&rsquo;s huddled figure,
then she went back, laid a hand on her arm and said
in an odd, gentle voice that was strangely unlike her
own brisk tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you mean to say that you don&rsquo;t just think
him the finest man in all the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther sat up with sudden passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of him at all&ndash;&ndash;it was like having a
knife turned in my heart when I knew,&rdquo; she said wildly.
&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t understand if you&rsquo;ve never cared for
anybody what it feels like to know that you&rsquo;ve been made
a fool of. When he told me I felt that I hated him&ndash;&ndash;there
didn&rsquo;t seem anything fine or good in what he had
done; I only knew that I&rsquo;d been played with, made fun
of....&rdquo; She stopped, sobbing desperately, but for
once June attempted no consolation. She was looking at
Micky&rsquo;s portrait on the shelf, and there was a wonderful
tenderness in her queer eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo; she asked then. &ldquo;Who told you that
it was Micky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did&ndash;&ndash;he only told me when he knew why I was
going to Paris&ndash;&ndash;he told me in the train. It&rsquo;s been from
Mr. Mellowes all along&ndash;&ndash;the money I&rsquo;ve had every week&ndash;&ndash;my
clothes&ndash;&ndash;this coat ... he&rsquo;s been paying for
my food, and for me to live here....&rdquo; She raised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
her eyes to June&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Did you know?&rdquo; she asked
shakily. &ldquo;He said you didn&rsquo;t, but somehow....&rdquo;</p>
<p>June rounded on her angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Micky said that I didn&rsquo;t, that ought to be good
enough,&rdquo; she said curtly. &ldquo;And of course, I didn&rsquo;t
know&ndash;&ndash;if I had, I should have told him that he was a
fool to waste his time and money on a girl who thought
nothing of him,&rdquo; she added flatly. Her voice changed
all at once. &ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t he just splendid!&rdquo; she said emotionally.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it in the very least, why
he has done it, or how he managed it, or anything, but
I think it&rsquo;s the finest thing in all the world&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Esther
turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew him before we met here&ndash;&ndash;he wanted to tell
you, but I asked him not to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She stopped and
dragged on again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met him on New Year&rsquo;s Eve&ndash;&ndash;I was so miserable&ndash;&ndash;there
seemed nothing to live for, and he was kind and
so ... so ... I told him a little of what was
wrong, and I suppose he guessed the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when he went to Paris that time it was all for
your sake, and it was for your sake he kept coming
here&ndash;&ndash;oh!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;June rose to her feet with a gesture of intolerance&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;if
you don&rsquo;t just adore the ground he walks
on,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you ought to, and that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got to
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther made no answer; she was looking into the fire
with eyes that as yet saw only the ruins of a dream that
had been so beautiful, the rapidly receding shadow of
the man whom she had once made a giant figure in her
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never want to care for any one again,&rdquo; she said
presently in a hard voice. &ldquo;You told me once that people
were happier if they didn&rsquo;t love, and I think you were
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was an idiot to ever say such a thing,&rdquo; June cried
in a rage. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re a bigger idiot if you pretend
to think I was right. There&rsquo;s nothing better in the whole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
world than being loved&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Her face flushed like a
rose. &ldquo;If Micky had cared for me even a quarter as
well as he does for you I would have married him, and
that&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;It was only because I
knew he hadn&rsquo;t anything except friendship to offer me
that I knew it wasn&rsquo;t fair....&rdquo; She tried to cover
the seriousness of her words with a laugh. She lit
another cigarette. &ldquo;And now, having got rid of my
heroics, let&rsquo;s talk sense,&rdquo; she added more calmly. &ldquo;But
you ought to go to bed. You look worn out. You&rsquo;ll
be a wreck in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go to bed. I have such a lot to tell
you. I shall have to leave here, of course; I haven&rsquo;t
got any money. I must try and find a post. I thought of
asking Eldred&rsquo;s to take me back; there might be a vacancy
now....&rdquo; But her voice sounded weary and hopeless.</p>
<p>June swooped down on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor tired baby, come along to bed and don&rsquo;t
worry any more. You&rsquo;ve got me whatever happens, and
if the worst comes to the worst there&rsquo;s always June
Mason&rsquo;s wonderful skin food for both of us to live on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went upstairs together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like sunshine to put you on good
terms with yourself,&rdquo; she said philosophically. &ldquo;Whenever
I&rsquo;m in the dumps or feel that I&rsquo;m looking particularly
plain, I put on my best hat and go out in the sunshine,
and I assure you I&rsquo;m a good-looking woman when I
come home again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always better than good-looking,&rdquo; Esther told
her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
</div>
<p>June tucked Esther up in bed and replenished the
fire. She turned out the gas, leaving the room fire-lit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;June,&rdquo; Esther said timidly. &ldquo;What did your aunt
think? What did she say&ndash;&ndash;when&ndash;&ndash;when&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said we must go back and finish our visit another
time&ndash;&ndash;she took a great fancy to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying that to please me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not! honest Injun!&rdquo; June heard the tears in
Esther&rsquo;s voice; she bent and kissed her gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, not another word! I refuse to answer another
question! Pleasant dreams&ndash;&ndash;or better still, no
dreams at all.&rdquo; She went away, and shut her door behind
her.</p>
<p>Esther lay awake for a long time watching the firelight
on the walls and ceiling, and thinking of what had
happened.</p>
<p>It seemed impossible that she had even really seen
and spoken to Raymond Ashton; impossible that instead
of loving him desperately, she could only shudder at the
memory of him.</p>
<p>The tears forced their way to her eyes, and scorched
her cheeks. But for Micky, where might she not have
been now?&ndash;&ndash;and he had refused to even let her thank
him. Her heart was filled with a new humility. At
best her words would be so poor&ndash;&ndash;like beggars in the
palace of his generosity.</p>
<p>But she would see him again soon&ndash;&ndash;she comforted herself
with the assurance. In spite of his changed manner
and apparent indifference, she was sure she would see
him again. Micky&ndash;&ndash;as June had said of him&ndash;&ndash;never
failed!</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></div>
<p>It was her last thought as she fell asleep, that she
would surely see him the next day.</p>
<p>But Micky did not come!</p>
<p>Esther rested till lunch time, after which June insisted
on a walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun&rsquo;s shining, and it&rsquo;s wicked to stay indoors,&rdquo;
she declared; she marched Esther about for half an
hour.</p>
<p>Esther had been so sure that Micky would come. She
glanced up at the clock, and then at Micky&rsquo;s photograph&ndash;&ndash;but
to-day he seemed to be looking past her into
the room to where June was bustling about, and she gave
a little sigh.</p>
<p>The evening dragged away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; June asked once
abruptly. &ldquo;You look so sad, don&rsquo;t look sad, my dear!
there&rsquo;s lots of happy days to come yet&ndash;&ndash;happier days
than you&rsquo;ve ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther was only half listening. It was too late for
Micky to come now was the thought in her mind. Supposing
he never came again?</p>
<p>She cried herself to sleep that night. When she woke
it was late in the morning, and June had had her breakfast
and gone out.</p>
<p>She came in while Esther was dressing. She looked
very pleased and alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business, my child!&rdquo; she said enthusiastically. &ldquo;Such
a duck of an American! and Micky&rsquo;s introduction! Mr.
George P. Rochester!&ndash;&ndash;isn&rsquo;t it a lovely name? He&rsquo;s
going to establish me firmly in little old New York, as
he calls it, and make my fortune. I&rsquo;m going out to lunch
with him at one o&rsquo;clock, and you&rsquo;re coming too!&ndash;&ndash;Oh,
yes you <i>are</i>!&rdquo; as Esther shook her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told him
all about you already.&rdquo; Esther laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have got on very fast,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And
anyway I&rsquo;m not going to play odd-man-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June made a little grimace.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I telephoned Micky and asked him to come and make
a fourth,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>
<p>Esther flushed. She looked up eagerly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;and is he coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>June shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said with overdone indifference.
&ldquo;He said he&rsquo;d got an engagement already, but between
you and me and the doorpost,&rdquo; she added darkly, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe it! I think he just didn&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Esther faintly. &ldquo;I expect he has a good
many engagements,&rdquo; she added after a moment.</p>
<p>June said &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; She recalled the curt manner of
Micky&rsquo;s refusal, and wondered if there had been a more
serious rupture between himself and Esther than she was
ever likely to hear about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we shall have to make up our minds to enjoy ourselves
without his distinguished company,&rdquo; she said airly.
&ldquo;I dare say we shall be able to manage quite nicely.
Esther, aren&rsquo;t you going to wear your fur coat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fur coat!&rdquo; said Esther rather unsteadily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was taking from the wardrobe the shabby jacket
she had worn the first night she met Micky; it looked
more shabby and unsmart than ever, but she was going
to wear it whatever happened.</p>
<p>She was smarting with humiliation. She had offered
Micky her little olive branch when they parted two days
ago at Charing Cross, and this is how he had accepted
it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s trying to pay me out, I suppose it&rsquo;s only what
I deserve,&rdquo; she thought miserably, and yet it did not seem
like Micky to deliberately try or wish to hurt or humiliate
any one.</p>
<p>She did her best to push the shadow aside. She tried
to laugh and talk with June as they went off to meet
Mr. George P. Rochester.</p>
<p>He was a big, bluff man, with a hand-clasp like the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
grip of a bear, and a twang that could be cut with a
knife.</p>
<p>They lunched at a restaurant which she had never
even heard of, though June seemed quite at home. There
were several people at other tables, whom June knew,
and Esther felt very out of it all, and unhappy.</p>
<p>It was a good thing she had refused to marry Micky,
she thought with a sort of anger. She knew none of his
friends and nothing of the life to which he had always
been accustomed. She did not realise that it was the
knowledge of her shabby coat that was affecting her
spirits more keenly than anything.</p>
<p>June&rsquo;s clothes were not new, but they had an unmistakable
&ldquo;cut&rdquo; about them, and Rochester was exceedingly
well dressed.</p>
<p>He talked to June a great deal. Once or twice he
tried to draw Esther into the conversation, but, seeing
that she wished to be let alone, he soon gave up the attempt.</p>
<p>He was certainly a most friendly person&ndash;&ndash;one would
have thought that he and June had known one another
for years. Before lunch was ended he had invited himself
to tea for the following afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Yankee push if you like!&rdquo; June said when
he had gone. &ldquo;Give me a Yankee every time to make
things go!&rdquo; She looked at Esther excitedly. &ldquo;Do you
know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a great mind to try and persuade
that man to come into partnership with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say he&rsquo;d suggest it himself if you give him
another day or two,&rdquo; she said drily. She wandered listlessly
round the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to leave here at the end of the week,&rdquo;
she said suddenly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to go on living here,
and letting you pay my rent and my food bill. I owe
you more than I can ever repay already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you talk like that I&rsquo;ll&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo; said June in
a rage. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand what friendship means.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
Micky had tried to teach you, and so have I, and all you
do is to throw it back in our faces.... O Esther,
don&rsquo;t!...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther had turned away and covered her face with
her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you think I&rsquo;m ungrateful and horrid,&rdquo; she
said brokenly. &ldquo;But how would you like to be in my
position? I haven&rsquo;t a shilling of my own in the world&ndash;&ndash;the
things I&rsquo;ve been wearing since I came here are paid
for by ... by ... oh, you know! I hate to
look at that fur coat and my new frock. You talk to me
about being proud and obstinate; well, I can&rsquo;t help it,
you must go on thinking it, that&rsquo;s all; I&rsquo;d rather die
than take anything more from any one. I kept myself
before, and I will again....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m a perfect beast,&rdquo; June
declared in remorse. &ldquo;But it does seem such a shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther raised a flushed face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t all have money and be independent,&rdquo; she
said hardily. &ldquo;But I think you might try and understand
how I feel about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only know that I&rsquo;m dying to help you, and you
won&rsquo;t let me,&rdquo; June said grumpily. &ldquo;Lord! where is my
cigarette case? I shall swear or do something worse if
I can&rsquo;t smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went out of the room, and Esther heard her go
clattering up the stairs. There were tears in her eyes
now, but she brushed them angrily away; after all, what
was there to cry for! It was only that she had got
to go back to where she had left off that New Year&rsquo;s
Eve when she first met Micky; everything was just as
it had been then, save that she was the poorer now by
the loss of a dream.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
</div>
<p>June&rsquo;s friendship with Mr. George P. Rochester
grew apace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky&rsquo;s introductions are <i>always</i> a success,&rdquo; she
told Esther. &ldquo;And Micky likes him too&ndash;&ndash;awfully! Mr.
Rochester is round at Micky&rsquo;s rooms nearly every night.
They&rsquo;re <i>ever</i> such pals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they?&rdquo; said Esther. The mention of Micky&rsquo;s name
always seemed to make her heart quiver. She wondered
if June knew why he never came to the house now, and
what she thought about it all.</p>
<p>In her own mind she was sure that Micky had cast
her off, and the knowledge left her with a sense of
desolation.</p>
<p>She never spoke of him unless June did so first, and
she tried never to think of him. But Micky was a personality
not to be lightly dismissed from memory, and
he haunted her thoughts waking and sleeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could only get some work,&rdquo; she told herself,
&ldquo;it would be better. It&rsquo;s so dreadful having nothing to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had applied to Eldred&rsquo;s unsuccessfully&ndash;&ndash;she had
climbed the narrow stairs of the agency a dozen times
only to be met with rebuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You refused an excellent post I offered to you,&rdquo; she
was told icily. &ldquo;I am not likely to be able to find you
such another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June coaxed her into helping with the &ldquo;swindle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll have to pay some one else to do it,&rdquo;
she declared. &ldquo;And oh, Esther, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> be so proud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Esther gave in. She filled the little mauve pots
with the profound skin food and fastened on lids and
labels till her head swam.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>Sometimes Mr. George P. Rochester came to help&ndash;&ndash;at
least he called it &ldquo;help&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;but he did very little actual
work, as he was always too busy looking at June and
talking to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he suggested the partnership yet?&rdquo; Esther asked
one night.</p>
<p>June flushed rosily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd,&rdquo; she answered, and something in
her voice woke a little note of fear in Esther&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Was she to lose June too? Was there to be nothing
left to her in all the world? Her hands shook as she
went on mechanically filling the row of little mauve
pots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther,&rdquo; said June suddenly, &ldquo;how long is it since
you saw Micky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little pause, then Esther said constrainedly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen him since&ndash;&ndash;since we came back
from Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked with an effort.</p>
<p>June kept her eyes bent on her work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I haven&rsquo;t seen him myself for nearly a
week,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;And I hear&ndash;&ndash;I hear that he&rsquo;s
running round with that Deland girl again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not dare to look up as she spoke, and she went
on quickly, &ldquo;Of course it may only be gossip&ndash;&ndash;but
George&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Rochester&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she hurriedly corrected
herself, &ldquo;tells me that Micky took him to their house
to dinner last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence. June filled pots at random, wildly, then Esther
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done eight dozen,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you think that
is enough to go on with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>June raised her eyes guiltily, then suddenly she pushed
the laden tray from her and ran round to Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said impulsively, &ldquo;if only&ndash;&ndash;only you could
have made yourself care for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></div>
<p>She put her arms round the younger girl&rsquo;s unresponsive
figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to be happy too, so badly,&rdquo; she went on
earnestly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to tell you yet, but I must
somehow. George&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Rochester&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she broke off,
laughing and crying together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s a perfect disgrace,&rdquo; she protested, &ldquo;I
told him so, too! I&rsquo;ve only known him three weeks,
and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she raised tear-drowned eyes to Esther&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;What can you do when a man that size kisses
you?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>Esther had to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, do what you did,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Kiss him in return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June wiped her eyes and laughed, and shed more tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never meant to marry any one,&rdquo; she said angrily.
&ldquo;But the dreadful creature seems to want me so desperately
badly. I&rsquo;m really utterly miserable, only&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O June!&rdquo; said Esther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am! At least!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;June looked up and suddenly
laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a wicked liar! but
oh, such a gloriously happy, wicked liar!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s all entirely due to me,&rdquo; Micky said when
June rang him up the following morning to tell him the
news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I introduced you! What do I get out of it all I
should like to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was playful, but June took him seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Micky! if you could only be as happy as I am,&rdquo;
she said eagerly.</p>
<p>Micky laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If wishes were horses, my dear&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he said sententiously.
&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t worry about me, I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, will you come to dinner to-night? No, <i>not</i> at
the boarding house! We&rsquo;ll go to the Savoy&ndash;&ndash;just to
celebrate! We four!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>four!</i>&rdquo; said Micky sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;I shall bring Esther, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the smallest possible pause, then Micky
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;ve another engagement. I promised
the Delands to go with them to the Hoopers&rsquo; dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June said &ldquo;<i>Hang</i> the Delands,&rdquo; and rang off in a
huff.</p>
<p>Micky hung up the receiver and turned away. He
was sorry to disappoint June, and yet he had no smallest
intention of meeting Esther. If she had wanted him she
would have sent a note or a message&ndash;&ndash;but she did not
want him! More than once she had said that she hated
him&ndash;&ndash;it was time to learn that she meant what she said.
Micky&rsquo;s pride had got the upper hand at last, and he
would rather have died now than make the smallest overture
to the girl at whose feet he had once been willing
to grovel.</p>
<p>Driver came to the door:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A parcel, sir. Shall I bring it in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky answered absently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driver went out of the room. After a moment he
came back with a square box which he set down on the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I open it, sir?&rdquo; he asked, as Micky did not
speak.</p>
<p>Micky started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; oh, yes&ndash;&ndash;open it. What the dickens is it? I
haven&rsquo;t ordered anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driver said that he did not know&ndash;&ndash;that it had been left
by a messenger. He untied the knotted string with neat
precision, and rolled it into a ball before he removed the
paper.</p>
<p>Micky walked up to the table and lifted the lid with
faint curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fur coat,&rdquo; he said blankly. &ldquo;A fur&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He stopped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
For a moment he stood staring down into the box, then
he let the lid fall over it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&ndash;&ndash;you can go,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Driver walked to the door stoically, and Micky went
back to the fire.</p>
<p>So she would not even keep the fur coat! She cared
so little for him that she must needs send back his paltry
gifts. What a fool he was to care&ndash;&ndash;what a fool!</p>
<p>Driver, coming back for a moment, stopped petrified
in the doorway. Micky was standing by the mantelpiece
with his face buried in his arms.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
</div>
<p>It was late that night when Micky turned up at the
Delands&rsquo;. He had taken extravagant pains with his
toilet, lingering over it as long as possible. Ever
since the arrival of that parcel from Esther, he had been
trying to make up his mind to take the irrevocable step,
and ask Marie Deland to be his wife. He was miserably
sure that she would accept him, miserably sure that he
was already forgiven for the past.</p>
<p>He kept on persuading himself that it was the one
and only thing left to him to do. He tried to believe
that once the affair was settled, he would find some sort
of happiness. After all, what did it matter whom he
married if it could not be Esther?</p>
<p>He looked pale but determined when he walked into
the Delands&rsquo; drawing-room and found Marie there alone.
She turned to greet him with a little eager movement
that was somehow comforting.</p>
<p>Here, at any rate, was some one who really cared for
him and was glad to see him. He took the hand she
held out and, bending, kissed it.</p>
<p>She caught her breath on a little sound that was almost
a sob, but she checked it instantly and tried to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is almost like old times,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite like old times,&rdquo; Micky answered recklessly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just turned the pages back again and gone on
where we left off, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her and tried to forget everything else.
She was pretty and dainty enough to satisfy the most
exciting man, and she loved him! To a man who is
disappointed and unhappy there is great consolation in
the knowledge that to one person at least he counts before
anything else in the world.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></div>
<p>She looked up at him, and impulsively he took a step
towards her; another moment and Micky would have
sealed his fate, had not Mrs. Deland pushed open the
door and walked into the room.</p>
<p>It had not been any effort for her to forgive Micky
for his cavalier treatment of her daughter. For the
last week she had been busy telling every one that Marie
and Micky had made up their quarrel&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;entirely Marie&rsquo;s
fault it was, you know,&rdquo; and so on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to give me half your dances at least,&rdquo;
Micky said, when they reached the Hoopers&rsquo;. He took
the card from Marie&rsquo;s hand and filled in his own initials
recklessly against the numbers.</p>
<p>She laughed tremulously; she was too happy to think
of anything but the present; she had got Micky again,
and that was all she cared about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-evening!&rdquo; said a voice at her side, and, turning,
she found Raymond Ashton at her elbow.</p>
<p>Marie did not care particularly for Ashton. She
greeted him rather coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re back in town,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And your wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here to-night,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;She has a bad
cold, so I persuaded her to stay at home. May I have
a dance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him her card reluctantly. She would have
liked to have refused, but she thought Micky would be
annoyed; she did not know that he and this man were
friends no longer.</p>
<p>She saw him glance at Micky&rsquo;s many initials on her
card, saw the half ironical smile he gave as he looked
at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mellowes is back, then?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;he came with us to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really! I thought&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he paused eloquently.</p>
<p>Marie flushed, she knew quite well what he meant; that
he must have known how Micky had once deserted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understood that Mellowes was in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashton went on calmly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;At least I was told so by an ... acquaintance
of mine&ndash;&ndash;who was staying there with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s eyes dilated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father and I crossed by the same boat as he did,&rdquo;
she said with an effort. &ldquo;He was alone then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashton laughed detestably. &ldquo;Ah, but not afterwards,&rdquo;
he said&ndash;&ndash;then checked himself. &ldquo;But I forgot. I must
not tell tales out of school, only as every one seems to
have learned of his <i>penchant</i> for the little lady from
Eldred&rsquo;s&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he laughed lightly.</p>
<p>Marie stood staring down the long ballroom. The
colour slowly faded from her cheeks, leaving her as
white as her frock. She looked at Ashton, intent on a
crease in his glove, and she broke out stammering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you say such a thing! I don&rsquo;t believe you&ndash;&ndash;in
Paris&ndash;&ndash;Micky&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his brows with assumed surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&ndash;&ndash;perhaps I should not have spoken&ndash;&ndash;but
I thought every one knew&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Of course it may be a
mistake, but I happen to know the lady in question
slightly&ndash;&ndash;through Mellowes&ndash;&ndash;and it was she who told
me.... I am sorry if my carelessness has pained
you&ndash;&ndash;excuse me, I am engaged for this dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed and left her standing there, white and
dazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it! I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she told herself despairingly,
and yet in her heart something told her that, for
once at least, Ashton had spoken the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our dance, I think,&rdquo; said Micky beside her.</p>
<p>She laid her hand on his arm mechanically; they went
the round of the room once, then Micky, glancing down,
saw how white she was and how her head drooped
towards his shoulder.</p>
<p>He tightened his arm a little&ndash;&ndash;he swept her skilfully
out of the crowd and into a small anteroom; he put
her into a chair and bent over her in concern.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You are not well&ndash;&ndash;what can I do? Can I get you
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she did not speak, then all at once she
rose to her feet; she clutched Micky by both arms; he
could feel how her hands shook; there was heartbroken
tragedy in her brown eyes as she looked into his face.
For once she had forgotten her pride and the indifference
into which she had been drilled for twenty years; she
was no longer Marie Deland, a sought-after and courted
beauty; she was just an unhappy, jealous woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t true, Micky, is it?&rdquo; she entreated him; her
voice was only a broken whisper. &ldquo;Tell me&ndash;&ndash;oh, please,
please, tell me. You don&rsquo;t care for her, do you?&ndash;&ndash;it
isn&rsquo;t true, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She forgot that he did not know of what she was
speaking; it seemed as if everybody in the world must
know of this tragedy that had desolated her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear it any longer&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s no use.... I&rsquo;ve
borne all I can.... O Micky ... Micky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He forced her hands from his arms; he put her back
into the chair and sat beside her; he hated to see the
white despair of her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re ill&ndash;&ndash;upset.... It&rsquo;s all right&ndash;&ndash;everything
is all right. You&rsquo;re not to worry any more....
Everything is all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment he would have given his soul could
he have truthfully said that he wanted her for his wife.
He cursed himself for a cur and a coward, but somehow
he could not force the words to his lips.</p>
<p>She lay back against the cushions, hiding her face.</p>
<p>There was a tragic moment of silence. Out in the
ballroom a noisy one-step was in boisterous progress;
there was a great deal of laughter and chattering; the
little anteroom seemed as if it must be in another
world.</p>
<p>Micky got up. He walked across the room and shut
the door. There was a hard look about his mouth. For
an instant he stood staring down at the floor irresolutely,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
then he came back to Marie. He bent over her, but he
did not touch her.</p>
<p>He spoke her name gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not raise her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you,&rdquo; he said huskily.</p>
<p>She looked up then. Her face was flashed and quivering,
and the brown eyes that for a moment met his own
were full of an unutterable grief and shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said in a broken whisper. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d just
go away&ndash;&ndash;and leave me to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky did not answer. The impossibility of ever going
back now struck him to the soul. This was the end,
the very end&ndash;&ndash;he had burned his boats and bidden good-bye
to the woman he loved for ever.</p>
<p>Then all his natural chivalry rose in his heart. Hitherto
it had been only of himself that he had thought,
but now ... his eyes softened as they rested on
the girl&rsquo;s bowed head; he stooped and took her hand, held
it fast in his steady grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me?&rdquo; he said very gently.</p>
<p>And, oh, the long time before she answered! It
seemed to Micky that he lived through years as he stood
there with the rattling tune of the one-step in his ears
and Marie&rsquo;s tragic figure before his eyes. Was she never
going to speak?</p>
<p>Then she sat up very stiff and straight&ndash;&ndash;there were
tears scorching her flushed cheeks, and her eyes seemed
to burn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I&ndash;&ndash;will I&ndash;&ndash;marry you?&rdquo; she echoed, as if not
understanding.</p>
<p>Her voice rose a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it isn&rsquo;t true ... it can&rsquo;t be true&ndash;&ndash;what he
said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say? Who are you talking about? What
do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began to sob; quiet, tearless sobs that seemed to
bring no relief with them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Raymond Ashton&ndash;&ndash;he told me&ndash;&ndash;here! just now&ndash;&ndash;that
you....&rdquo; She stopped, catching her breath at the
change in Micky&rsquo;s face; it no longer looked tender&ndash;&ndash;his
eyes were fierce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ashton! What has he said?&rdquo; His voice was roughly
insistent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me that you&ndash;&ndash;you were in Paris&ndash;&ndash;a week or
two ago&ndash;&ndash;with a girl from Eldred&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; The words escaped Micky before he could
check them; his first thought was to defend Esther. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
an infernal lie!&rdquo; he said again violently.</p>
<p>It turned him cold to think of all that the brute must
have implied.</p>
<p>The tears were frozen on Marie&rsquo;s cheeks&ndash;&ndash;her hands
were clasped together in her lap.</p>
<p>When at last she found her voice it was strained and
cracked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;... that she told him you were there with her....&rdquo;
Her brown eyes searched his face as if they
were trying to read his very soul. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; she
said shrilly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s she who is lying&ndash;&ndash;she told Raymond
Ashton that she was there with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told him....&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Micky stood like a man turned to stone.
Was this the truth?&ndash;&ndash;that Esther had told Ashton....</p>
<p>He looked again at Marie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did Ashton tell you this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night&ndash;&ndash;not a moment ago&ndash;&ndash;he is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Then to how many more people had he told
the same distorted story?</p>
<p>The blood beat into Micky&rsquo;s face; it seemed to hammer
maddeningly against his temples. Nothing counted
but the fact that Esther&rsquo;s name was being bandied about
on the lips of the creature. To stop him&ndash;&ndash;to stop his
lying tongue was the one thought in Micky&rsquo;s mind; he
saw the whole world red as he tore open the door of the
silent room and strode out into the corridor.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></div>
<p>The noisy ragtime had ceased, but a storm of deafening
applause and cries of &ldquo;Encore!&rdquo; filled the ballroom.</p>
<p>An elderly man cannoned into Micky, and stopped
short with a laughing apology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Mellowes&ndash;&ndash;not dancing&ndash;&ndash;what the deuce is
the matter?&rdquo; he asked with sudden change of voice.</p>
<p>Micky passed a shaking hand across his mouth&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing ... where&rsquo;s Ashton&ndash;&ndash;have you seen
Ashton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just left him; he isn&rsquo;t dancing either. Can&rsquo;t
think what&rsquo;s happened to you youngsters to-day. When
I was your age....&rdquo; He broke off, realising that
Micky was not listening. &ldquo;Ashton&rsquo;s in the smoking-room,&rdquo;
he said uneasily.</p>
<p>Micky went on; his hands were clenched, his teeth set.</p>
<p>The smoking-room door was half ajar; he could see
that there were several men there. There was a clink of
glasses and the sound of voices talking in a rather subdued
way.</p>
<p>Micky paused. He knew that if Ashton were there it
would mean a scene, and a scene in any one else&rsquo;s house....
The thought snapped at the sound of his own
name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mellowes! Well, you do surprise me.&rdquo; There was
a chuckle. &ldquo;Always thought he was one of the good
boys.... It just shows that you never know a man
till you find him out. Rather an error of judgment to
choose Paris, eh? Who did you say she was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl from Eldred&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;pretty little thing. I knew her
before he did. As a matter of fact, it was only when I
cooled off....&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was Ashton&rsquo;s voice; Micky could not see him,
but he could picture vividly the eloquent shrug, the meaning
smile with which he finished his incomplete sentence.</p>
<p>The hot blood died down, leaving him cool and alert.
He pushed the door wide and walked into the room.</p>
<p>The group of men by the fireplace scattered; some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
one coughed deprecatingly; some one else seized upon
a siphon and began filling an already full glass recklessly.</p>
<p>Nobody spoke.</p>
<p>Micky kicked the door to behind him, shutting it with
a slam.</p>
<p>His eyes went straight to Ashton&ndash;&ndash;a pale Ashton, trying
to smile unconcernedly and brazen the situation out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you two minutes in which to apologise,&rdquo;
Micky said in a voice of steel. &ldquo;Two minutes in which
to retract the damned lies you&rsquo;ve just been saying in
this room&ndash;&ndash;or&ndash;&ndash;or I&rsquo;ll thrash you within an inch of your
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the silence following one could have heard a pin
drop. Every one looked at Ashton. Micky took out his
watch.</p>
<p>It seemed an eternity before Ashton spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve been listening&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he began blustering.</p>
<p>He moistened his dry lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I said is the truth,&rdquo; he broke out spluttering.
&ldquo;You were in Paris with....&rdquo; But the name was
never spoken&ndash;&ndash;Micky&rsquo;s clenched fist shot out and struck
him right in the mouth.</p>
<p>In a moment the room was in an uproar; half a dozen
men rushed at Micky and pinned his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mellowes&ndash;&ndash;for God&rsquo;s sake&ndash;&ndash;if Hooper comes in....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashton had staggered back against the wall; his mouth
was cut and bleeding; he was swearing horribly.</p>
<p>Micky was crimson in the face; the veins stood out
like cords on his forehead; he was straining every nerve
to free himself from his captors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apologise!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Apologise, you dammed
cad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ashton laughed savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apologise! What for? It&rsquo;s the truth, and you know
it. Apologise! I&rsquo;ll repeat it.... I say that you
were in Paris three weeks ago with Esther Shepstone,
one of the girls from Eldred&rsquo;s....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky suddenly stopped struggling, but his breath
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
came in deep gasps as he spoke. He looked round at
the faces of the other men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know most of you&ndash;&ndash;here,&rdquo; he said in a laboured
voice. &ldquo;And most of you know me&ndash;&ndash;and you know that
I&rsquo;m not a damned liar like Ashton; and I know that
you&rsquo;ll believe me&ndash;&ndash;believe me&ndash;&ndash;when I tell you that the
lady who was with me in&ndash;&ndash;in Paris&ndash;&ndash;three weeks ago&ndash;&ndash;is
my wife ... we&rsquo;ve been married some time&ndash;&ndash;and
it is solely by her wish that it has been kept a
secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Micky had dropped a bomb in the room it could
hardly have created more consternation. The incredulity
on the faces of the men around him would have been
amusing to an onlooker, but to Micky the whole thing
was tragedy.</p>
<p>He had brought Esther to this with his blundering
quixotism; he was nearly beside himself with remorse.</p>
<p>If he had been free he would have half killed Ashton.
His hands ached to get at him; to take him by his
lying throat and choke the breath from his body.</p>
<p>He looked at the men around him with passionate eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never given any of you cause to doubt my word
yet,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree with
me that this man should be made to retract what he
said and apologise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly&ndash;&ndash;he ought to apologise. It&rsquo;s disgraceful&ndash;&ndash;infernally
disgraceful,&rdquo; said a man who had been listening
to Ashton&rsquo;s story eagerly enough a moment ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a chorus of assent. The men who had been
holding Micky&rsquo;s arms let him go.</p>
<p>Ashton backed a step away.</p>
<p>His face was livid, his eyes furious, but he knew that
there was no other course open to him; nobody in the
room had any sympathy with him now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I apologise,&rdquo; he said savagely. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;lady&ndash;&ndash;Mellowes
had married&ndash;&ndash;the lady.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></div>
<p>His tone added that even now he did not believe it;
he edged away to the door and disappeared.</p>
<p>Micky dropped into a chair; he looked thoroughly
done up. Some one pushed a glass of whisky across to
him. There was an uncomfortable silence. Perhaps
they were all feeling guilty; perhaps they all remembered
with what relish they had listened to this spicy bit of
scandal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never could stand Ashton,&rdquo; some one said presently,
in gruff abasement. &ldquo;Worm&ndash;&ndash;the man is!&ndash;&ndash;perfect outsider!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were several grunts of assent; the sympathy
was decidedly with Micky.</p>
<p>After a moment he rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose an apology is due from me too,&rdquo; he said;
he spoke with difficulty. &ldquo;But I think any of you&ndash;&ndash;in
the same circumstances&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right&ndash;&ndash;certainly.... Should have done the
same myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am sure you won&rsquo;t let this go any further&ndash;&ndash;for&ndash;&ndash;for
my wife&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>They pressed round him, shaking him by the hand
and reassuring him. Micky took it for what it was
worth. He knew that those of them who were married
men would go straight home and tell their wives of the
scene at Hoopers&rsquo;, and he knew how speedily the story
would spread.</p>
<p>He got away as soon as he could and left the house.</p>
<p>He never gave Marie another thought, till he found
himself out in the street and walking away through the
fresh spring night.</p>
<p>He took off his hat and let the air blow on his hot
forehead; his hand still trembled with excitement.</p>
<p>He tried to think, but his thoughts would not come
clearly. When he got back to his rooms he asked Driver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
for a stiff brandy. The man looked at his master diffidently,
and asked if anything were the matter.</p>
<p>Micky laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Do I look as if there is?&rdquo; He glanced at
himself in the mirror. His face was very white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s nothing the matter. I&rsquo;m tired, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driver turned to the door, but Micky called him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been with me a good many years, Driver,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been a faithful servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s stolidness did not change a fraction.</p>
<p>Micky took a gulp at the brandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were to hear that I&rsquo;m married, you wouldn&rsquo;t
be surprised, would you?&rdquo; he asked with a rush.</p>
<p>Driver stood immovable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would even say that you knew that I&rsquo;ve been
married some weeks, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good&ndash;&ndash;you may go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir, and good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said Micky.</p>
<p>And now, what was to be done now?</p>
<p>When he left this room three hours ago it had been
with the determination to put the past behind him for
ever, and what had he done? Only walked more deeply
into his quixotism and seriously compromised the woman
he loved.</p>
<p>He had said that she was his wife. It gave him a
little thrill to remember that a dozen of his acquaintances
had heard him say it, and were probably even now
spreading the story of his marriage far and wide.</p>
<p>He paced up and down the room. He had failed all
round; even love and desperate desire had not been able
to help him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>He thought suddenly of June; June who, with all her
bluntness, had a great heart and a deep understanding.</p>
<p>She would not want explanations; she would know
why he had done it, and sympathise.</p>
<p>But June was obviously not the one concerned. It
was not to June that he must confess.</p>
<p>The clock in his room struck twelve; too late to do
anything to-night. The memory of Marie returned&ndash;&ndash;Marie
as she had looked when he found her in the drawing-room
that night; as she had looked when he had left
her in the little anteroom at the Hoopers&rsquo; and gone out
with murder in his heart to find Ashton.</p>
<p>He stopped dead in his pacing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you cad&ndash;&ndash;you cad!&rdquo; he said with a groan.</p>
<p>Life was an intolerable, purposeless thing. He sat
down at his desk and leaned his head in his hands. His
whole life seemed to spell failure. With sudden impulse
he seized a pen and began to write.</p>
<p>For the first few moments he hardly knew what he
wrote. It was only when he reached the end of the
first page that he seemed to realise with a start what he
had done. He looked back at the written lines with
something of a shock. There was no beginning to the
letter, no date or address; it simply started off as if the
pen had been guided by some influence outside himself,
some desperate need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you will think when you get this letter. I
am writing it because to-night I think I am half mad. I love you
so much; there seems nothing in the whole world that counts
any more now that I am beginning to understand that I can
never have you. Esther, I ask you on my knees to listen to
what I have to say. I have tried to keep away from you, to
forget you; I&rsquo;ve tried to put you out of my heart and persuade
myself that I do not care&ndash;&ndash;but it&rsquo;s no use. I love you; I know
you care something for me, but I shall love you always. To-night
I have done an unpardonable thing for your sake. I explain
things so badly. I can only hope that you will understand and
try to make some excuse for me. Some one knows we were
together in Paris&ndash;&ndash;I need not tell you who. To-night, at a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
house where I was, he had told several people that you and I
had been to Paris together....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Micky had gone on writing rapidly&ndash;&ndash;he seemed to
have lost himself in a sea of eloquence; his heart was
pleading with the woman he loved through the poor
medium of a sheet of unaddressed paper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It nearly drove me mad to hear you spoken of by him. There
was a scene, and I knocked him down ... you will hate me
for this, but I would have killed him if they had let me. I told
them afterwards that you were my wife&ndash;&ndash;try and understand
how I have suffered all these weeks&ndash;&ndash;I told them that we had
been married some time, and that it had been kept secret by
your own wish. It&rsquo;s only now, when I am more alone and can
think clearly, that I see what I have done. You don&rsquo;t care for
me, and I have compromised you even more than that man did
by his lying insinuations. Tell me what I am to do&ndash;&ndash;anything,
anything in the world. My whole life is yours to do with as
you will. Be my wife, dear, be my wife....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a moment the pen faltered, but Micky went on
again with an effort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I will stay in London twenty-four hours for your answer,
and then, if I don&rsquo;t hear....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pen faltered again, and this time finally stopped.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The question is,&rdquo; said June critically, looking out
of the window to the street where a fine drizzle of
rain was falling, &ldquo;does one, or does one not, wear
one&rsquo;s best hat to go out and meet the one and only man
one has ever loved?&rdquo; She turned round and looked at
Esther with a little nod. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s grammar, though you
may not think it, my dear,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Esther laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say one does wear one&rsquo;s best hat,&rdquo; she said
decidedly. &ldquo;Especially seeing what a very charming hat
it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leaned her elbows on the table and looked at June
admiringly. &ldquo;How long is it since you saw the great
and only?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>June did some rapid counting on her white fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nineteen hours exactly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But it seems
like ninety! I nearly died with joy when his note came
at breakfast time&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She looked at Esther wistfully.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how lovely it is to have some one of
your very own,&rdquo; she said with unwonted sentimentality.</p>
<p>Esther averted her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I envy you,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll be late
if you stand rhapsodising here&ndash;&ndash;be off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>June bent and kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be long&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s only asked me for lunch....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have known lunches that lasted till tea-time,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;When there has been a great deal to talk about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June went downstairs singing. During the last few
days she had, as she would have expressed it, begun to
discover herself all over again. Certainly the world had
utterly changed, and was more like a fairy city than a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
place where it rained a great deal and where buses and
taxicabs splashed pedestrians with mud.</p>
<p>Lydia met her at the foot of the stairs; she smiled at
sight of the new hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just coming up, Miss June,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a letter for Miss Shepstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June held out her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it, and save you the trouble&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She became
conscious all at once of the girl&rsquo;s admiring eyes,
and blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like my hat, Lydia?&rdquo; She turned round for
inspection.</p>
<p>Lydia admired enthusiastically, as she admired everything
of June&rsquo;s, and forgetful of everything but the
moment, June thrust the letter for Esther into her coat
pocket and went out blissfully into the rain to meet
George Rochester.</p>
<p>George was ardent; he went into rhapsodies over the
hat; he forgot to eat his most excellent lunch, and hardly
took his eyes off June.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so much waste of time this being engaged,&rdquo;
he said with pretended annoyance. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we do
the trick and get married? What are we waiting for?
I&rsquo;ll take you to the States for a wedding trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June laughed, and protested blushingly that it was
much too soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thought about it,&rdquo; she declared, not quite
truthfully. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s tons of things to see to first. What
about my business and Esther?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the one to look after the other,&rdquo; he said
promptly.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;I should hate to leave Esther alone; if
only she could be married too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;find her a husband. What about Mellowes?&rdquo;
he suggested jokingly.</p>
<p>June&rsquo;s face sobered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&ndash;&ndash;Micky!&rdquo; she said. She was not sure if she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
justified in telling Rochester that Micky had once cared
for Esther. &ldquo;I thought he was practically engaged to
Marie Deland,&rdquo; she said doubtfully.</p>
<p>Rochester gave an exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There seems to have
been a bit of a row at the Hoopers&rsquo; dance last night....
I wasn&rsquo;t there&ndash;&ndash;but I heard some fellows at the
club talking it over just now. Do you know a man
named Ashton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>June sniffed inelegantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t like him, you&rsquo;ll be pleased to hear
that Micky knocked him into the middle of next week,&rdquo;
Rochester said calmly.</p>
<p>June&rsquo;s eyes gleamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! Well, I&rsquo;m delighted to hear it! What was
it about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rochester shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they were gossiping about some woman, as far
as I could make out&ndash;&ndash;a woman Micky had been rather
friendly with, from what I gathered&ndash;&ndash;they didn&rsquo;t mention
her name, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; he hesitated. &ldquo;They spoke of
her as a girl from ... I&rsquo;ve forgotten the name,
but I think it was a petticoat shop&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eldred&rsquo;s?&rdquo; said June sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was it! What do you know about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&ndash;&ndash;go on! What were they saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she&rsquo;d been to Paris with Mellowes, and Mellowes
overheard it, and there was a bit of a fight, and
Mellowes said that the girl was his wife....&rdquo;</p>
<p>June gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rochester looked rather uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only club talk,&rdquo; he said deprecatingly. &ldquo;Dare say
it&rsquo;s all lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June pushed back her chair; her brain was in a whirl;
she stared at Rochester with dazed eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;re mad, quite mad,&rdquo; she said calmly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Or I am! which is it?... My dear man, the
girl Micky went to Paris with was Esther! <i>my</i> Esther
Shepstone! and here you are trying to tell me that she
and Micky are <i>married</i>!&rdquo; She burst into hysterical
laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to tell you,&rdquo; he protested injuredly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only what I heard; and any way, if Mellowes went
to Paris with Miss Shepstone&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off before the anger in June&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you speak about Esther in that tone of voice again,
I shall hate you for ever,&rdquo; she said furiously. &ldquo;If you
must know the truth, I&rsquo;ll tell it to you, and another time
just don&rsquo;t judge people till you&rsquo;ve heard both sides of
the question,&rdquo; and she promptly proceeded to tell him
the whole story of her meeting with Esther, and all that
had happened since.</p>
<p>Rochester listened quietly, but when she had finished,
he said&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Micky ought to have finished that skunk last night.
If he cares for Miss Shepstone....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh but I don&rsquo;t think he does now,&rdquo; June struck in
sadly. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t been near her since they came back
from Paris, and every one says that Marie Deland&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
she broke off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when Miss Shepstone gets to hear what happened
last night?&rdquo; Rochester asked drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but she won&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;she doesn&rsquo;t know anybody who
would tell her except you or me,&rdquo; June said positively.
&ldquo;And of course she must <i>never</i> know. She never liked
Micky, though <i>why</i>!...&rdquo; She shrugged her shoulders.
&ldquo;Have you seen him to-day?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m going to this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t let him know what I&rsquo;ve told you?
promise me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it likely that I should? Men don&rsquo;t gossip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; June answered tartly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
trust one of them, not even you,&rdquo; she added with a
melting smile.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></div>
<p>In spite of her promise to Esther, it was past tea-time
when she got back home; she threw her hat and
coat down anywhere and poked up the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you had tea? What have you been doing all
day?&rdquo; she demanded crisply. &ldquo;You <i>haven&rsquo;t</i> had tea!&ndash;&ndash;Good
gracious, I&rsquo;ll make some at once; I had some with
George, but I&rsquo;m quite ready for some more. My word!
what a difference a man can make in one&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; she
said, suddenly grave. &ldquo;And to think that I ever talked
piffle about not wanting to get married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bustled round the room singing blithely; she was
brimful of happiness. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be surprised to hear
that I&rsquo;m going to be married quite soon,&rdquo; she said with
elaborate carelessness. &ldquo;Lord! won&rsquo;t people have forty
fits? Except for Micky, my crowd don&rsquo;t know I&rsquo;m engaged
yet. I&rsquo;m going to take George home to see them
on Sunday. I&rsquo;ve discovered that he&rsquo;s fourth cousin,
about ninety times removed, to a baronet, so, perhaps,
that will put them all in a good temper with him. My
people do love titles! Give them a lord, or something,
and it doesn&rsquo;t matter what else he is, or isn&rsquo;t....
You&rsquo;re not listening, Esther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am. I heard every word you said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther was sitting by the fire with Charlie curled up
in her lap; her face looked very sad and thoughtful.
So she was to lose June quite soon!&ndash;&ndash;her lips trembled;
what was there left for her in all the world? It almost
seemed as if time had stood still for a moment, and then
suddenly rushed her back again with breathless speed,
to leave her bereft of hope and happiness, as she had
been before she met Micky.</p>
<p>Charlie had been her only friend then. Was he all
that was to remain to her now?</p>
<p>June watched her across the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; she asked suddenly;
but Esther only shook her head.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></div>
<p>For two days Micky Mellowes never left his rooms,
and hardly ate a thing, and for once in his life Driver
permitted a spark of anxiety to creep into his dull eyes.
He was sure that his master was ill; he tried tempting
dishes and alluring cocktails, but Micky refused them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good man, I&rsquo;m not an invalid,&rdquo; he protested irritably.</p>
<p>He hated it, because he knew his agitation was apparent;
he tried to settle to read, but whenever a bell
rang through the house he started up with racing pulses.</p>
<p>She must have got his letter, he knew. If there was
any hope for him at all she would write at once or send
for him. His nerves began to wear to rags.</p>
<p>Sometimes his hopes soared to the skies, to drop to
zero again. Once in a fit of despondency he told Driver
to pack his bag, as they would be leaving early in the
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&ndash;&ndash;where shall we be going, sir?&rdquo; Driver asked
stoically.</p>
<p>Micky swore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do ask such damned silly questions,&rdquo; he complained
irritably.</p>
<p>An hour later, when he found Driver packing, he called
him a fool, and told him to unpack at once.</p>
<p>And so the days dragged away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any more posts to-night?&rdquo; Micky asked jerkily, on
the second day.</p>
<p>Driver eyed the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There should be one at nine, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But nine came, and half-past, and no post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it too late for the post now, Driver?&rdquo; Micky asked
feverishly, when it was nearly ten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The post went by, sir,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I was
down at the door and saw the postman pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky went back to his chair. It was all he could
expect, he told himself&ndash;&ndash;there had been no answer to his
letter: there never would be an answer now.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></div>
<p>When Driver came into the room again, Micky said
without looking up&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pack that bag again, there&rsquo;s a good fellow, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Driver imperturbably.</p>
<p>He hesitated, then asked&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;where did you say we should be going,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; said Micky. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t care&ndash;&ndash;on
the Continent&ndash;&ndash;anywhere you like&ndash;&ndash;look up some
hotels....&rdquo;</p>
<p>One place was as good as another, he argued, as he
sat and watched Driver pack. Wherever he went he
was going to be infernally miserable, so what did it
matter?</p>
<p>When Driver stoically inquired how long he expected
to be away, Micky answered violently that he was never
coming back if he could help it; he said he hated London&ndash;&ndash;he
said he was sick to death of his flat and wanted
a change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t come back till the autumn anyway,&rdquo; he
declared recklessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; was the stolid reply. Driver knew
his master; he could remember another occasion when
Micky had left London in a rage never to return, and
ten days had seen him back again.</p>
<p>Certainly this was rather a different case from that
other; this time there was a woman behind it. Driver
knew this perfectly well, though beyond the posting of
letters and the buying of the fur coat he had had no firsthand
evidence.</p>
<p>But he kept his thoughts to himself and packed shirts
and socks and coats by the score, as if to keep up the
belief that they were really going for months, instead
of the day which were the limit he prescribed in his own
mind.</p>
<p>When Rochester called later on in the evening, Micky
was almost rude to him. The American looked so unfeignedly
happy that it got on Micky&rsquo;s nerves; but George
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
P. Rochester was difficult to snub; he looked on at the
packing with childlike amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sudden idea of yours, this flitting!&rdquo; he submitted
mildly. Micky did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;ll be back in time for my wedding, Sonnie,&rdquo;
Rochester said again.</p>
<p>Micky flushed crimson; there was something rather
pathetic about him at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be back all right,&rdquo; he said shortly.</p>
<p>Rochester laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to stay away long then,&rdquo; he said
significantly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
</div>
<p>Esther woke from a troubled sleep that night, to
find June standing beside her. Pale moonlight
shone into the room from half-drawn blinds, filling
it with an eerie light, as Esther started up trembling and
frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? is anything the matter? Oh, I thought
you were a ghost!&rdquo; She clutched at June with both
hands. &ldquo;Oh, is anything the matter?&rdquo; she asked again.</p>
<p>June laughed nervously; she found matches and lit a
candle, then she came back to Esther and thrust something
into her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never forgive me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve had
it in my coat pocket for two days....&rdquo; She pushed
her dark hair back from her forehead tragically. &ldquo;Lydia
gave it to me for you the day I went out in my best hat
to meet George, and I was such a selfish, conceited pig
that he put everything else out of my head, and I forgot
all about it till just now, when I was lying awake thinking
... and then ... oh, Esther, it&rsquo;s from
Micky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther looked down at the crumpled envelope&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From&ndash;&ndash;Micky?...&rdquo; she said. She was only half
awake; she made a very fair picture there with her long
hair tumbling about her shoulders, and her face a little
flushed and startled.</p>
<p>June turned to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go away&ndash;&ndash;you don&rsquo;t want me.... I&rsquo;ll
go&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; but Esther caught her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;no.... Wait! please wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well&ndash;&ndash;but I&rsquo;m half frozen....&rdquo; June looked
plaintively at Esther, but Esther had forgotten her, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
she dragged the quilt from the bed, and wrapped it round
her small figure till she looked like a mummy.</p>
<p>There was a long silence, then Esther raised her eyes
to June&rsquo;s anxious face.</p>
<p>Her own was quite colourless, and her grey eyes
looked dazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you&ndash;&ndash;will you&ndash;&ndash;read it?&rdquo; she said faintly.
&ldquo;Please&ndash;&ndash;I want you to&ndash;&ndash;I ... somehow I feel as
if I&rsquo;m dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But June at any rate was wide awake. It only took
her two minutes to read Micky&rsquo;s passionate appeal; the
next she was laughing and crying together, and hugging
Esther boisterously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t he the most wonderful man? Don&rsquo;t you
love him? Don&rsquo;t you just adore him? Oh, if you&rsquo;re
going to break his heart after all this, I&rsquo;ll <i>never</i> forgive
you!... Why, my George isn&rsquo;t in it with Micky,
poor darling!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she shook Esther in her excitement&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;What
are you made of, that you can&rsquo;t see what a king
he is? I don&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s any blood in your veins
at all,&rdquo; she declared indignantly. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got a
heart.... Oh, Esther darling! I didn&rsquo;t mean it&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;oh,
I&rsquo;m such an idiot!...&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the two girls clasped each other and cried together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now if this ridiculous midnight scene is ended,&rdquo;
June said presently, sniffing her tears away, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s talk
sense. I&rsquo;ll go and see Micky in the morning and explain
everything. He knows what I am&ndash;&ndash;he won&rsquo;t be at all
surprised&ndash;&ndash;oh, I&rsquo;m so glad&ndash;&ndash;so more than glad....
Oh, Esther, <i>why</i> do you hide your face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m so ashamed,&rdquo; Esther said in a stifled
voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worth loving&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve ... oh, you
don&rsquo;t <i>know</i> how I&rsquo;ve treated him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>June was silent for a minute, then she said gently&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Micky will forget all that&ndash;&ndash;Micky never remembered
a mean thing against anybody in his life.&rdquo; She
forced Esther to look at her. &ldquo;Tell me one thing, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
then I&rsquo;ll go and leave you in peace,&rdquo; she coaxed. &ldquo;Do
you&ndash;&ndash;do you ... <i>you</i> know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in this instance, at least, a verbal answer was not
necessary.</p>
<p>June kissed her rapturously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you darling,&rdquo; she said. She blew out the candle,
and sped down to her own room again like a ghost in
the moonlight.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&ldquo;Was there anything else you was wanting, sir?&rdquo;
Driver inquired stolidly. He stood on the platform looking
in at the first-class compartment where Micky sat
alone in durance vile, waiting for the train to start.</p>
<p>He frowned, and pulled his soft hat further down over
his eyes as he answered&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing.... I&rsquo;ll see you at Dover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were many people on the platform; in the next
carriage a pretty girl was seeing a man off&ndash;&ndash;looking up
at him as he stood on the footboard with eyes that told
their story eloquently.</p>
<p>Micky looked at her enviously. He would have given
his right hand if there had been some one there to see
him off with just that expression in her eyes&ndash;&ndash;the right
some one, of course. He turned away from the window
with an uncomfortable lump in his throat.</p>
<p>He had nothing in the world but his confounded
money, and a lot of good that was to him! It could not
buy happiness.</p>
<p>The guard came down the platform&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your seats&ndash;&ndash;take your seats....&rdquo;</p>
<p>A girl and a man pushed past him. The girl was
staring eagerly in at all the windows as she passed.
When she saw Micky she gave a little cry of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is&ndash;&ndash;Micky! Micky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky started to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;June!&rdquo; he said. For a moment he thought something
must have happened&ndash;&ndash;something was wrong&ndash;&ndash;Esther!...
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
her name was trembling on his lips, but June rushed on
impetuously before he had time to speak it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought we&rsquo;d come and see you off&ndash;&ndash;George told
me you were going, and I guessed you&rsquo;d be on this
train.... I&rsquo;m so glad we found you&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s rotten
seeing oneself off, isn&rsquo;t it?...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rochester came up laughing and red in the face; he
took off his hat and mopped his hot forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep pace with her, she&rsquo;s like a whirlwind,&rdquo;
he said whimsically. &ldquo;She raced me off here before I
could say a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of you to come,&rdquo; Micky said.</p>
<p>He was pleased to see them; he felt decidedly less
ill-tempered than he had done a moment ago. He looked
down at June&rsquo;s radiant face, and a little doubt went
through his heart.</p>
<p>He was in that dangerous state through which so
many men have to pass when the woman they love will
have none of them. If Marie Deland had happened to
turn up then, he would have asked for forgiveness and
have married her offhand and regretted it the next day;
and now, as he looked at June, he wondered if he had
been a fool not to properly appreciate her. He felt
a vague twinge of jealousy, realising that the days were
gone for ever when he had been the most wonderful
man in all the world to her.</p>
<p>He had never loved her save in a brotherly way, and
he did not love her now, but at heart men are all dogs
in the manger, and it was some such feeling that filled
Micky&rsquo;s heart as he leaned out of the window and looked
at this girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll have a good time,&rdquo; she said cheerily.
&ldquo;Have you got anything to read?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t want anything&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m not in a reading mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky was longing to ask about Esther, but pride prevented
him.</p>
<p>The guard was blowing his whistle; doors were slamming;
June gripped Micky&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Be a good boy, and have a good time,&rdquo; she said.
There was a furious excitement in her eyes.</p>
<p>He made a grimace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not expecting to have a good time,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>The train was slowly moving; June ran a few steps to
keep up with it. Micky blurted out his question at last&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Shepstone ... Esther ... is she all
right, June?&rdquo;</p>
<p>June smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s first rate,&rdquo; she said airily. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone
away for a holiday.... Good-bye.&rdquo; She fell back
laughing and waving her hand.</p>
<p>Micky kept his head out of the window till a cloud
of smoke from the engine blown backwards shut out
all sight of her, then he drew in, dragging the window
up with a slam.</p>
<p>Gone away for a holiday, had she?&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;it was nothing
to him. He turned round to go back to his seat in the
corner then stopping dead, staring as if he had seen a
ghost; for Esther was sitting there just behind him,
looking up at him with scared eyes.</p>
<p>For a moment Micky did not move; he was like a
man turned to stone. Then the blood rushed to his face
in a crimson tide; he broke out into stammering speech&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ... you ... what ... what ...
I thought....&rdquo; He swayed forward a little and caught
her hands. &ldquo;You are real&ndash;&ndash;I thought ... I thought
I was just imagining it all; I thought.... Oh, wait
a moment....&rdquo; He sat down and leaned his head
in his hands.</p>
<p>He felt sure that he must be mad or dreaming&ndash;&ndash;the
world had turned upside down and pitched his thoughts
into chaos; he was sure that when next he looked Esther
would no longer be there&ndash;&ndash;he dreaded having to raise
his eyes.</p>
<p>Esther stretched a timid hand to him; her voice shook
as she said&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought ... I thought perhaps you&rsquo;d be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
glad to see me&ndash;&ndash;just ... just a little&ndash;&ndash;glad....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad!&rdquo; Micky echoed the word with almost a shout.
He got up and went over to her; he looked down at her
with an agony of doubt and fear in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you come?&rdquo; he asked hoarsely. &ldquo;If this
is only a joke&ndash;&ndash;if it&rsquo;s any nonsense of June&rsquo;s ...
by God, it&rsquo;s the cruellest joke you could have played on
me.... I&ndash;&ndash;I....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esther covered her face with her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got to say to me,&rdquo; she began
tremblingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew her hands down; he forced her to look at
him; for a long moment his eyes searched her face disbelievingly,
not daring to hope....</p>
<p>Her cheeks flamed, but she met his eyes bravely.</p>
<p>Micky drew a long breath; he passed a hand across
his eyes as if to waken himself.</p>
<p>Then all at once he seemed to realise that this was
in very truth the woman he wanted sitting beside him;
that she was here and for his sake; that he was alone
and unhappy no longer; and that after all the weeks of
hunger and restlessness he had got his heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>He looked down at her tremulous face with eyes of
passionate tenderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this my wife?&rdquo; he asked hoarsely, and Esther answered&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you still want me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want you!&rdquo; Micky caught her to him. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I
always wanted you?...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately the train was not very full, and the corridor
immediately outside their carriage was deserted,
or somebody might have had a very interesting demonstration
of how to kiss a woman who had refused for
months to be kissed.</p>
<p>Micky was like a boy in his happiness. He looked
years younger than the gloomy man who had dismissed
Driver ten minutes since. He could not take his eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
from Esther&ndash;&ndash;he could not believe in his own happiness
even while he was engulfed in it. His arm was round
her, regardless of chance wanderers in the corridor&ndash;&ndash;he
held her hand to his lips and kissed it passionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done with ... that other ring
you used to wear?&rdquo; he asked jealously.</p>
<p>She turned her face away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I threw it out of the window when we came back
from Paris,&rdquo; she told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you another. I&rsquo;m going to give you everything
you want now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been too good to me already,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
can never repay you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given me yourself. There is nothing else in
the world that I want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed happily.</p>
<p>He bent his head towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esther ... when did you ... when did
you first ... think that you liked me ... just
a little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her head dropped; he could not see her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Paris,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;or before? Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it was in Paris&ndash;&ndash;after ... after I saw
... Raymond! You were so kind ... so different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was nearer hating you then than ever in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw the colour creep into her face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told
me ever so many times that you hated me,&rdquo; he went on
quickly, &ldquo;but you never told me that you ... loved
me, Esther!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited, but she did not look at him.</p>
<p>Then suddenly she took his hand in both of hers; she
bent her head and kissed it with a sort of passionate
gratitude that brought a mist to Micky&rsquo;s eyes. He seemed
to see her all at once as he had first seen her that New
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
Year&rsquo;s Eve; alone, unhappy&ndash;&ndash;with nobody to care what
she did, or what became of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so much, much too good for me,&rdquo; she said
brokenly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done everything for me, and I&rsquo;ve
done nothing for you&ndash;&ndash;I haven&rsquo;t even been ... nice!
I can&rsquo;t tell you what I feel about it all&ndash;&ndash;I only know
that&ndash;&ndash;just lately&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ve&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ve made everything seem
so different&ndash;&ndash;since you wrote me that letter&ndash;&ndash;it makes
me feel in my heart that it&rsquo;s always really been you&ndash;&ndash;always
you, and never ... never any one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; said Micky huskily. &ldquo;And perhaps&ndash;&ndash;some
day&ndash;&ndash;do you ... do you ... think ...
you could ever care for me more than ... than you
cared for ... that other fellow, confound him!&rdquo; he
added fiercely.</p>
<p>She looked up at him and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;that I only ... only
really began to care for&ndash;&ndash;him&ndash;&ndash;when he went away&ndash;&ndash;and
when those letters began to come; and so you see&ndash;&ndash;it
was always you, because it was you who wrote them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a rotten thing to do, but I wanted to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did help me ... and&ndash;&ndash;Micky....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fur coat ... can I&ndash;&ndash;will you give it back
to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you everything in the world if you&rsquo;ll say you
love me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do&ndash;&ndash;I....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it then,&rdquo; he urged gently.</p>
<p>For a moment she did not answer; she was still a
little afraid of him; she still felt something of pride and
constraint between them; though she knew it was for her
to sweep away the last barrier.</p>
<p>She looked up at him, the sensitive colour rushing to
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Oh, Micky, some one
will see&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></div>
<p>But Micky only laughed.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The train was running on to Dover Harbour before
Micky realised it; he looked at Esther with pretended dismay
in his happy eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray, what am I to do with you, madame? Do
you realise that I&rsquo;m going to Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going there too&ndash;&ndash;of
course, if you&rsquo;d like to travel in a different train to
me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was a very different Esther from the pale, frightened-looking
girl who had said good-bye to June at Victoria.
Her eyes were dancing now, and her face was
radiant. Micky regarded her with proud satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look years younger and prettier already,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s after only an hour or two of my wonderful
society; so what you&rsquo;ll look like when we&rsquo;ve been
married for years and years....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, and a sudden emotion filled his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do, love of mine?&rdquo; he asked tenderly,
&ldquo;Shall we go on, or shall we go back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind&ndash;&ndash;either way, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to
pay for me,&rdquo; she told him saucily. &ldquo;June rushed me
off so, I forgot my purse&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Rochester got me a ticket,
but....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go on,&rdquo; said Micky hurriedly. The train was
almost at a standstill. &ldquo;You said you hated Paris&ndash;&ndash;but
you won&rsquo;t hate it with me. We&rsquo;ll get married as soon
as we get there&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll take you everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any nice clothes&ndash;&ndash;I only brought a small
case; I never thought you ... you....&rdquo; She
stopped, stammering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paris is full of clothes,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay
just long enough to buy what you want, and then we&rsquo;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
go south. Esther, you&rsquo;ve never seen the south of France
in springtime, have you? I&rsquo;ll take you there for our
honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew back a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Micky&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s June&ndash;&ndash;what will she say&ndash;&ndash;what
will she think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll think that you&rsquo;ve behaved sensibly&ndash;&ndash;at last!&rdquo;
he answered audaciously. &ldquo;June knew she wouldn&rsquo;t
see either of us again for some time when we left her at
Victoria&ndash;&ndash;June is a most discerning woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dear,&rdquo; said Esther warmly. &ldquo;I owe all my
happiness to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky pretended to look offended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was under the delusion that you owed it to me,&rdquo;
he said with dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you!&rdquo; Her face changed wonderfully; she bent
her head and kissed the sleeve of his coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk about what I owe you&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s just&ndash;&ndash;everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Micky drew himself up a dignified inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think I&rsquo;m a very wonderful man,
do you know?&rdquo; he said, addressing some imaginary person.</p>
<p>Driver appeared at the door. He hesitated for just
the faintest possible moment when he saw Esther, but
his face was as stolid as ever.</p>
<p>Micky rose to the occasion, though he turned rather
red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Driver,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let me introduce you to my
wife&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driver touched a respectful forelock; if he felt surprise
he did not show it.</p>
<p>He took Esther&rsquo;s suit-case down from the rack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was you&ndash;&ndash;was you wanting to send a wire, sir?&rdquo;
he asked stolidly.</p>
<p>Micky looked at the girl beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send June one from Paris,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what she&rsquo;ll say&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></div>
<p>But June might have been expecting the wire, judging
from the calm way in which she received it; she showed
it to Rochester as if it were nothing out of the way;
she looked over his shoulder as he read it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Married in Paris this morning. Love from Mr. and Mrs.
Micky.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She laughed and met Rochester&rsquo;s eyes; there seemed
